 For questions regarding programming in ECMAScript (JavaScript/JS) and its various dialects/implementations (excluding ActionScript).
"Please include all relevant tags on your question; e.g., [node.js], [jquery], [json], etc."
"JavaScript (a dialect of ECMAScript) is a high-level, dynamic, multi-paradigm, object-oriented, prototype-based, weakly-typed, and interpreted language traditionally used for client-side scripting in web browsers."
"JavaScript (a dialect of ECMAScript) can also be run outside of the browser with the use of a framework like Node.js, Nashorn, Wakanda, or Google Apps Script."
"Despite the name, it is unrelated to the Java programming language and shares only superficial similarities."
"Unless a tag for a framework or library is also included, a pure JavaScript (a dialect of ECMAScript) answer is expected for questions with the javascript tag."
"JavaScript (a dialect of ECMAScript) runs on nearly every operating system, and an engine is included in mainstream web browsers."
"Developed in 1995 by Brendan Eich at Netscape Communications, JavaScript (a dialect of ECMAScript) was originally called LiveScript but was renamed to JavaScript (a dialect of ECMAScript) due to Netscape's friendly relationship with Sun Microsystems (creators of Java) at the time."
"Standalone JavaScript (a dialect of ECMAScript) engines or interpreters are available as well, including: The Mozilla Developer Network contains high-quality documentation on JavaScript (a dialect of ECMAScript)."
JavaScript (a dialect of ECMAScript) is typically used to manipulate the Document Object Model (DOM) and Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) within the browser.
"This allows user interface scripting, animation, automation, client-side validation, and much more."
"With the recent emergence of platforms such as Node.js, JavaScript (a dialect of ECMAScript) can now be used to write server-side applications."
"In addition, The Mozilla Developer Network is also used in environments that aren't web-based, like PDF documents, site-specific browsers, desktop widgets, etc."
"Although The Mozilla Developer Network was developed under the name Mocha, the language was officially called LiveScript when the language first shipped in beta releases of Netscape Navigator 2.0 in September 1995, but the language was renamed JavaScript (a dialect of ECMAScript) when the language was deployed in the Netscape browser version 2.0B3."
The change of name from LiveScript to JavaScript (a dialect of ECMAScript) roughly coincided with Netscape adding support for Java technology in Netscape Netscape Netscape Navigator 2.0 web browser.
"The final choice of name caused confusion, giving the impression that the language was a spin-off of the Java programming language, and the choice has been characterized as a marketing ploy by Netscape to give JavaScript the cachet of what was then the hot, new web-programming language."
The language and the term originated from Netscape.
"ECMAScript, JavaScript, and JScript are terms that are easy to confuse."
ECMAScript was developed as a standardization of Netscape's JavaScript and Microsoft's independently-developed JScript.
The canonical reference is the ECMAScript03 2015 Language Specification.
"While JavaScript and JScript aim to be compatible with ECMAScript, JavaScript and JScript also provide additional features (and other deviations) not described in the ECMA specifications."
The differences today for those who use JavaScript are negligible; people generally do not distinguish the JavaScript and JScript variations from ECMAScript.
"Most modern browsers implement JavaScript based on the ECMAScript 6 specification, although some fail to implement some ES6 features."
"However, older browsers such as Internet Explorer 8 implement the ECMAScript 3 specification, which does not contain functions such as Function.prototype.bind, and even JSON.parse, among others."
"You can see the current browser support of ES6 features The current version of ECMAScript is ECMAScript 10, properly known as ECMAScript 2019, which was finalized in June 2019."
JavaScript and the DOM provide the potential for malicious authors to deliver scripts to run on a client computer via the Web.
Browser authors contain this risk using two restrictions.
"First, scripts run in a sandbox in which scripts can only perform web-related actions, not general-purpose programming tasks like creating files."
"Second, scripts are constrained by the same-origin policy:"
"scripts from one Web site do not have access to information such as usernames, passwords, or cookies sent to another site."
Most JavaScript-related security bugs are breaches of either the same origin policy or the sandbox.
Content Security Policy is the main intended method of ensuring that only trusted code is executed on a Web page.
XSS is a frequent type of attempting to steal data or harm a website via JavaScript.

"Java is a high-level, platform-independent, object-oriented, functional programming language and runtime environment."
"The Java language derives much of  Java syntax from C and C++, but  Java object model is simpler than that of the latter and  Java has fewer low-level facilities."
Java applications are typically compiled to bytecode (called class files) that can be executed by The JVM.
The JVM often further compiles code to native machine code to optimize performance.
The JVM manages memory with the help of a garbage collector (see garbage-collection) in order to handle object removal from memory when objects are no longer in use.  
"Java's typing discipline is static, strong, safe, nominative, and manifest.  "
Java supports features such as reflection and interfacing with C and C++ via the JNI (Java Native Interface).  
"Java is designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible, intended to allow application developers to write once, run anywhere, or sometimes write once, run everywhere (code that executes on one platform does not need to be recompiled to run on another).  "
"Java was originally developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems (which fully merged with Oracle Corporation on January 27th, 2010) and was released in 1995 as a core component of Sun Microsystems'  Java platform.  "
Java was started as a project called \"Oak\" by James Gosling in June 1991.
The  Java platform is the name given by Sun (now Oracle) to computing systems that have installed tools for developing and running  Java programs.
The Java platform features a wide variety of tools that can help developers work efficiently with the  Java programming language.
"To get started, you download a Java Development Kit (JDK), which lets you both develop and run  Java applications."
"The main reference implementation of  Java is open source (the OpenJDK) and is supported by major companies including Oracle, Apple, SAP, and IBM."
Very few computers can run  Java programs directly.  
Java apps intended to run directly on client computers should ship with Java apps own installers.
"Prior to java9, you asked end users to install a so-called JRE; however, this concept has been deprecated).  "
"Java is compiled into bytecode, which is then compiled by the JVM into native machine code."
"This was initially viewed as a performance hit, but JVM and just-in-time (JIT) compilation improvements have made this less of a concern."
"In some cases, the JVM JVM may even be faster than native code compiled to target an older version of a processor for backward-compatibility reasons."
"Since  Java,  Java can be compiled ahead-of-time (AOT)."
"Notable  Java versions, code names (in the [] brackets), and release dates (in the parentheses) include: Since Java SE 10, new versions will be released every six months."
"For more code names and release dates, visit Java SE Code Names."
"To see release notes for each version of the JDK, visit the Wikipedia article on  Java version history."
"java code on your machine, you need a java installer package supplier.  "
"Java is open source, but a supplier will take care of building the java source code into a binary, wrapping this into an installer, and maintaining this version on your machine (e.g. with security updates).  "
Java comes in LTS (Long-Term-Support) and non-LTS versions.
Each supplier chooses how to deal with LTS versions.
"Some (Oracle OpenJDK) have the same short support window for all releases, LTS or not."
Some (Amazon Coretto) do not bother to release non-LTS versions at all.
Most suppliers release all versions that will support LTS versions for far longer.

"Unlike many other languages,  Python uses an indentation-based syntax (in which tabs and spaces are noninterchangeable)."
This may take some getting used to for programmers who are familiar with using braces.
"To help with the transition, using a properly configured text-editor or IDE is recommended."
"Python comes with a basic IDE called IDLE (python-idle), to get you started."
"Other popular examples are the charityware Vim, the free GNU Emacs, Eclipse+PyDev, or PyCharm."

Questions regarding  HTML (HyperText Markup Language) should include a minimal reproducible example and some idea of what you're trying to achieve.
This tag is rarely used alone and is often paired with [CSS] and [javascript].
HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the markup language used for structuring web pages and other information to be displayed in a web browser.
"HTML describes the structure of a web-page semantically along with cues for presentation, making HTML a markup language rather than a programming language."
"A browser 'renders' HTML in conjunction with CSS, which defines the 'style' (colors, fonts, layout, etc.) and JavaScript, which defines interactive and dynamic elements, adding style and behavior to the pages."
https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/ is the canonical HTML specification.  
HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the main markup language for creating web pages and other information to be displayed to humans in a web-browser.  
HTML (HyperText Markup Language) was invented by Sir Tim Berners-Lee while developing the first Web browser at CERN to enable researchers to share researchers findings and formally released in June 1993.
The original \"HTML Tags\" were first publicly mentioned by Berners-Lee in 1991 and borrowed the syntax from CERN's SGML-based documentation standard.
The latest version for  HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is HTML5.2.
HTML elements form the building blocks of all web-pages.  
HTML (HyperText Markup Language) allows images and objects to be embedded in a page.  
HTML (HyperText Markup Language) references styles and scripts and carries meta-data.  
HTML (HyperText Markup Language) can be used to create interactive forms.  
"HTML (HyperText Markup Language) provides a means to create structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes and other items.  "
"HTML (HyperText Markup Language) can embed scripts written in languages such as JavaScript, which affects the behavior of HTML web pages."
"Web pages written in different programming languages (PHP, JSP, VF, ASP.NET etc.)"
HTML is a hierarchical (tree-structured) markup language.
"That is, an item might be a descendant of another item, which is its ancestor."
"However, if item2 is a descendant of item1, then they have an additional special relation:"
"item2 is inside of item1, or item1 is wrapped around"
"item2. HTML is written in the form of elements consisting of tags (and their attributes) enclosed in angle brackets (e.g., <html>)."
"The first is known as the opening tag and the second, which includes a forward slash, as the closing tag (e.g., <h1> and </h1>)."
"Various types of content, such as text or additional HTML elements, can be contained within these tags."
"Some tags, however, are unpaired, and these are known as empty elements or self-closing tags."
"these may or may not include the slash (e.g., <img> or <img />)."
"Web browsers read these documents, interpret each of the HTML tags, and then render Web browsers corresponding visual and/or audible display in the form of a webpage."
"HTML standards, as well as those for many other web technologies, are maintained by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)."
"HTML4 was introduced in 1997, and the latest iteration, HTML5, was recently developed by the W3C."
"What W3C calls HTML5 is a subset, with a few modifications, of the HTML-Living-Standard which is specified by the Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group (WHATWG)."
The language specification and standards documents for HTML5 are available online.
"HTML markups are designed, or 'styled', via CSS (Cascading Style Sheets), using one or more of the following: Dynamic and interactive parts of a page are programmed most frequently via JavaScript, using one or more of the following:"
" jQuery is a JavaScript library, consider also adding the JavaScript tag.    "
"jQuery is a popular cross-browser JavaScript library that facilitates Document Object Model (DOM) traversal, event handling, animations and AJAX interactions by minimizing the discrepancies across browsers."
"A question tagged  jQuery should be related to  jQuery, so  jQuery should be used by the code in question and at least jQuery usage-related elements need to be in the question.  "
"jQuery is a cross-browser JavaScript library (created by John Resig) that provides abstractions for common client-side tasks such as DOM traversal, DOM manipulation, event handling, animation and AJAX.  "
"jQuery simplifies HTML document traversal and manipulation, event handling, animation, and AJAX due to its API that works across a multitude of browsers.  "
jQuery provides a platform to create plugins that extend  jQuery capabilities beyond those already provided by the library.
The development of  jQuery and related projects is coordinated by the jQuery Foundation.
"jQuery supports the current stable version, and the preceding version or \"current - 1 version,\" of Chrome, Edge, Firefox, and Safari."
"the preceding version or \"current - 1 version,\" of Chrome, Edge, Firefox, and Safari also supports the current stable version of Opera."
"In addition,  jQuery supports Internet Explorer version 6 or higher."
"However, support for IE 6-8 was dropped by jQuery 2.x and by jQuery 3.x, which support only IE 9 or higher."
"Finally,  jQuery supports the stock mobile browser on Android 4.0 and higher, and Safari on iOS 7 and higher.  "
"jQuery is updated frequently, so the library should be used carefully."
Some functions become deprecated with newer versions of  jQuery.
Follow the release notes to be on track with the features.  
"jQuery provides download links for all versions of  jQuery, including the latest stable versions of each branch."
in the alert box on each link click after the DOM is ready (JSFiddle):
"If your code is somehow manipulating the DOM, then you need to ensure that your code is run after the DOM finishes loading."
jQuery provides ways to do that with an anonymous function: These are alternatives to placing the JavaScript code or script tag in the HTML right before the closing
"In  jQuery, the recommended way to add a ready handler is $(function () {}), while other forms such as $(document).ready(function () {}) are deprecated."
"Also, jQuery 3.x removes the ability to use .on(\"ready\", function () {}) to run a function on the \"ready\" event."
"If your jQuery code conflicts with another library that also uses the $ sign as an alias, then use the noConflict() method: Then you can safely use $ as an alias for the other library while using the name jQuery itself for jQuery functions."
"For example: It is also possible to assign jQuery to $ within a certain scope: Then you can use $ as an alias for jQuery inside that function block, without worrying about conflicts with other libraries."
Calling the jQuery function repeatedly is extremely inefficient.
Avoid doing this: Instead cache your jQuery object in a variable:
"Or better yet, use chaining to reduce repetition: Also, remember that many functions can perform multiple changes in one call, by grouping all the values into an object."
Instead of: jQuery wrapped variables are usually named starting with $ to distinguish jQuery wrapped variables from standard JavaScript objects.
"While one of the goals of jQuery is to abstract away the DOM, knowing DOM properties can be extremely useful."
"One of the most commonly made mistakes by those who learn jQuery without learning about the DOM is to utilize jQuery to access properties of an element: In the above code, this refers to the element from which the click event handler was fired."
"The code above is both slow and verbose; the code below functions identically and is much shorter, faster and more readable."
"Although the following two examples seem to be functionally equivalent and syntactically correct, the first example is preferred: By comparison, a string concatenation approach is much less readable and far more brittle: While the first example will be slower than the second, the benefits of greater clarity will likely outweigh the nominal speed differences in all but the most performance-sensitive applications."
"Moreover, the idiomatic syntax is robust against the injection of special characters."
"For instance, in the 2nd example, a quote character in variable would prematurely close the attributes."
Doing the proper encoding by yourself remains possible even if not recommended because it is prone to error.

"In 1998, the C++ Committee published the first international standard for C++ ISO/IEC 14882:1998, which would be informally known as C++98."
"In 2003, the C++ Committee responded to multiple problems that were reported with c++98, and revised it accordingly."
"The language standard remained pretty much the same for a long time, but in 2011 a new standard, C++11 (formerly known as C++0x) was published in ISO/IEC 14882:2011."
"Rather than in a \"big bang\" approach, it is being rolled out gradually as compilers are supporting the new language features."
"See Bjarne Stroustrup's C++11 FAQ to see what is new in The changed language, and check your own compiler's FAQ to see which of those features are currently supported: A few features that had been under discussion for C++11 have been deferred to the next iteration."
C++14 was approved in August 2014 and released in December of the same year.
Previously referred to as C++1y as the year of approval was uncertain.
Many popular compilers already have some level of C++14 support.
C++17 adds a few more major features (and several minor ones).
"It is usually referred to as C++1z or C++17, as technical work on the new standard was completed in March of 2017."
the new standard was approved (unanimously) by the ISO in September of 2017 and officially published in December 2017.
In February 2020 the C++ Standard committee completed work on C++20.
It was unanimously approved later that year and got officially published in December 2020.

" CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a representation style sheet language used for describing the look and formatting of HTML (HyperText Markup Language), XML (Extensible Markup Language) documents and SVG elements including (but not limited to) colors, layout, fonts, and animations.  "
"CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) also describes how elements should be rendered on screen, on paper, in speech, or on other media."
"CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, is a language used to control the visual presentation of documents written in a markup language, including HTML, XML, XHTML, SVG, and XUL."
"The visual presentation of HTML was originally defined by HTML attributes, but HTML 4 deprecated these attributes as CSS was introduced to separate the control of the visual presentation from content."
"In October 1994, H02kon Wium Lie first proposed Cascading HTML Style Sheets while working at CERN with Sir Tim Berners-Lee, who had been developing a web browser and inventing HTML."
"Each rule set starts with a selector, a pattern that matches elements in a HTML or XML document, and is followed by a block of zero or more property declarations that define the presentation of the matching elements."
The selector is quasi-identical to the selector used by Javascript's .querySelectorAll.
For example: example above also illustrates the cascading element of CSS.
"When you hover over a link (i.e., an <a> element) in an HTML page with this style sheet applied to this style sheet, both rules apply."
"Because of Each rule, the link will have a pink background."
"But, since the a:hover selector is more specific, the a:hover selector"
color and text-decoration properties override those from the <a> rule-set.
The cascading order defines how specificity and other factors determine which property value is applied to an element.
"Each component of a CSS selector can be based on one or more of four possible attributes of an HTML element: Selectors using an ID selector have higher priority than selectors using class names, and selectors using a class name have higher priority than selectors using tag names."
"important annotation can be used to override selector precedence, by elevating a normal declaration to an important declaration."
"Whenever possible, however, higher specificity within a normal declaration should be used in preference to the creation of an important declaration via the !important annotation, in order to prevent overrides on any other styles that might need to be added, particularly those that are subsequently added with a natural precedence intent."
"In the above example, the text color of the content of the <a> element, the string \"Sample\", will be green."
"Repeated occurrences of the same selector also increase specificity, as noted in the Selectors Level 3 W3C Recommendation."
"Here, the repeated selector has higher specificity than the singular selector, and the font-weight of our sample string will be bold."
Specificity is basically a measure of how specific a selector is ― how many elements a selector could match.
"Class selectors have a higher specificity, so [classes] will win against element selectors."
"ID selectors have an even higher specificity, so [IDs] will win against class selectors."
Complex selectors can be created by joining multiple simple ones together.
It is also possible to style elements depending on an attribute: A CSS rule specificity calculator is available here.
It may help when a project has one or multiple large CSS files.
Inheritance is the mechanism by which properties are applied not only to a specified element but also to Inheritance descendants.
"In general, descendant elements automatically inherit text-related properties, but box-related properties are not automatically inherited."
It is worth noting that any property can be inherited by using the inherit property value.
"This should be used with care, however, since Internet Explorer (up to and including version 7) doesn’t support this keyword."
"As an example: For questions related to CSS, try to demonstrate your code in a reproducible manner using either Stack Exchange's Stack Snippets or alternatively any online editor that allows running and sharing code such as JS Bin, JSFiddle or CodePen (though be sure to always include relevant code in the question)."

" iOS is the mobile operating system running on the Apple iPhone, iPod touch, and iPad."
Use this tag [ios] for questions related to programming on the iOS platform.
Use the related tags [objective-c] and [swift] for issues specific to those programming languages.  
iOS is a mobile operating system created and developed by Apple Inc. exclusively for  iOS hardware.  
"iOS is the operating system that presently powers many of  iOS's mobile devices, including the iPhone, iPad, and iPod Touch."
"the operating system that presently powers many of the company's mobile devices, including the iPhone, iPad, and iPod Touch should not be confused with i5/OS, which is one of IBM's operating systems for the IBM Power Systems (originally AS/400), or with Cisco's IOS (Inter-network Operating System).  "
"iOS Latest Stable Release:  iOS (18C66) released on December 14, 2020"
"iOS 14.4 beta 1 (18D5030e) released on December 16, 2020  iOS is a derivative of Apple's OSX desktop operating system, with which  iOS shares many (but not all) common frameworks and other components."
"These include Cocoa Touch (the counterpart of the OS X Cocoa UI Framework), the Mach/Darwin/XNU kernel and code from the Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD)."
Applications for  iOS are written for the Cocoa Touch framework (as opposed to OS X's Cocoa framework) using the same Xcode IDE for official use (i.e. for submitting applications to Apple's App Store) or using unofficial (mostly command-line only) toolchains for various operating systems (including Linux) for unofficial/jailbroken development.
"OS X is based on the Darwin-OS foundation, itself based on several Unix descendants."
"On June 2nd, 2014, Apple announced a new language, Swift, which could be used to develop apps for  iOS."
"Swift was in beta until September 9th, 2014, and is, since September 17th, 2018, at version 4.2.0."
"Each  iOS application runs in  iOS own secure sandbox to prevent (accidentally or intentionally) altering other applications, the operating system, or any other data."
"Since  iOS, an  iOS application can have extensions that extend custom functionality beyond the application.  "
"iOS is optimized for the power, graphics, processor, and memory constraints of mobile devices."
Interface is based on the concept of direct manipulation through multi-touch gestures.
"Interface control elements consist of sliders, switches, and buttons, all included in Apple's UIKit Framework."
"Interaction with the OS includes gestures such as swipe, tap, pinch, and reverse pinch, all of which have specific definitions within the context of the iOS operating system and iOS multi-touch interface."
Internal accelerometers and gyroscopes can be used by applications to respond to the user shaking the device (one application is the undo command) or rotating one application in three dimensions (one common result is switching from portrait to landscape mode or autorotation).
"Apple initially adapted features from OS X to create iOS, but that cycle is now bidirectional."
"Many features on the OS X 10.7 OSX Lion were implemented first in iOS, including application sandboxing, an OS X App Store (and the implied widespread third-party app code signing), the content-centric (\"natural\") scrolling direction, along with AV Foundation, Core Location, and a few other frameworks."
CocoaPods is a dependency manager for Swift and Objective-C Cocoa projects.
CocoaPods includes almost ten thousand libraries to help programmers scale projects.
"A popular alternative is Carthage, which is a decentralized dependency manager, meaning that CocoaPods does not store a central list of available projects."
Use the tag iOS for questions about Cisco's iOS operating system for Cisco network routers.
Before you ask about custom controls: I want this type of control.
"You will get lots of custom controls, animation, libraries and much more which is available in Swift and Objective-C. Before asking about a topic, just search it in  https://developer.apple.com/documentation/ also, which is the developer documentation provided by the apple which covers a lot of information regarding iOS development."

" MySQL is a free, open source Relational Database Management System (RDBMS) that uses Structured Query Language (SQL).  "
"DO NOT USE this tag for other DBs such as SQL Server, SQLite etc.  "
Those are different DBs which all use Those own dialects of SQL to manage the data.  
MySQL is an Open Source RDBMS (Relational Database Management System) that runs as a server providing multi-user access to a number of databases.  
MySQL source code is available under the GNU (General Public License).  
MariaDB is a fork of  MySQL using the same dialect of SQL and offering most of the same functions.
See mariadb for fork-specific questions and answers.  
MySQL offers standard database driver connectivity for using  MySQL with applications and tools that are compatible with industry standards ODBC and JDBC.
Please see this post: Tips for asking a good Structured Query Language (SQL) question to get tips on how to ask a question about  MySQL.
Following some of these steps will help people to help you solve your problem.
"Officially it is /ma010507skju090407l/ (\"My S-Q-L\"), but is often pronounced /ma0104si09kw05l/ (\"My Sequel\")."
Latest Version (MySQL Community Server 8.0.21) and Version History
 Structured Query Language (SQL) is a language for querying databases.
"Questions should include code examples, table structure, sample data, and a tag for the DBMS implementation (e.g. MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, MS SQL Server, IBM DB2, etc.)"
"If your question relates solely to a specific DBMS (uses specific extensions/features), use that DBMS's tag instead."
Answers to questions tagged with  Structured Query Language (SQL) should use ISO/IEC standard  Structured Query Language (SQL).
ISO/IEC standard SQL stands for Structured Query Language (informally) and usually pronounced as Sequel.
ISO/IEC standard SQL is based on relational algebra.
"In relational algebra, the word relation is synonymous with the word table."
ISO/IEC standard SQL is a standard to use relational algebra in a technical environment.
"One subset of the ISO/IEC standard SQL standard is DDL (Data Definition Language), which is used to create tables and constraints."
"Another subset is DML (Data Manipulation Language), which is used to modify and view data within the database: The final \"standard\" subset of commands is DCL (Data Control Language):"
"Many database implementations require the use of ISO/IEC standard SQL, and over the years, vendors have implemented dialects of ISO/IEC standard SQL to provide more functionality as well as simplify more functionality."
"Because of these deviations from the standard, ISO/IEC standard SQL is fractured C syntax that works on one implementation does not necessarily work on another."
"ISO/IEC (formerly ANSI) standards have been beneficial in resolving such situations, but adoption is selective."
"Queries conforming to ISO/IEC (formerly ANSI) standards should be portable to other databases, though performance may vary."
Most DBMSs have additional languages for writing stored procedures.
"In Oracle this is PL/SQL (Procedural Language/Structured Query Language), in PostgreSQL"
"Outside of stored procedures or functions, Oracle and PostgreSQL use ISO/IEC standard SQL."
Thus the tags plsql and plpgsql should only be used for problems directly related to writing stored procedures.
"Microsoft SQL Server uses the term T-SQL (Transact-SQL)(tsql) for both \"plain\" SQL (queries, DML, ..) and the language used for stored procedures."
"the mysql tag should be used for general SQL programming language questions, in addition to tags for specific products."
"For example, questions about Microsoft SQL Server should use the sql-server tag, while questions regarding MySQL should use the mysql tag."
"Microsoft SQL Server is the umbrella under which these products exist; tagging these products by product (including version, e.g oracle11g, sql-server-2008, hana) is the easiest way to know what functionality is available for the task at hand."
It is very common for MySQL questions to omit the mysql tag because query discussions on MySQL are more often stated as MySQL rather than SQL in general.
"Please read this summary about the SQL standard (the 1992 one in this case, broadly implemented) and if you can, refer to the book itself."
When you are asking a question about Microsoft SQL Server you can also add more specific tags.
Here is the list of available tags: You can specify your question by adding the implementation you used as a tag.
"While you should always provide complete code examples (e.g., schema, data sample and expected result) in your question or answer, you can also isolate problematic code and reproduce problematic code in an online environment:"
" R is a free, open-source programming language and software environment for statistical computing, bioinformatics, visualization, and general computing."
Please provide minimal and reproducible example(s) along with the desired output.
Use dput() for data and specify all non-base packages with library() calls.
"Do not embed pictures for data or code, use indented code blocks instead."
"For statistics related questions, use https://stats.stackexchange.com.  "
"R is a free, open-source programming language and software environment for statistical computing, bioinformatics, information graphics, and general computing."
It is a multi-paradigm language and dynamically typed.  
R is an implementation of the S programming language combined with lexical scoping semantics inspired by Scheme.  
R was created by Ross Ihaka and Robert Gentleman and is now developed by the R Development Core Team.
"The R environment is easily extended through a packaging system on CRAN, the Comprehensive R Archive Network."
"This tag should be used for programming-related questions about R. Including a minimal reproducible example in your question will increase your chances of getting a timely, useful answer."
Questions should not use This tag unless they relate specifically to the RStudio interface and not just the R language.
"If your question is more focused on statistics or data science, use Cross Validated or Data Science, respectively.  "
Bioinformatics-specific questions may be better received on Bioconductor Support or Biostars.
"General questions about R (such as requests for off-site resources or discussion questions) are unsuitable for StackOverflow and may be appropriate for one of the general, or special-interest, R mailing lists."
"Do research (read tag wikis, look at existing questions, or search online) to determine the most appropriate venue so that you have a better chance of receiving solutions to your question."
your question may be automatically migrated to a more appropriate StackExchange site.
"If you receive no response to your questions after a few days, or if your question is put on hold for being off-topic, it is then OK to post to another venue, giving a link to your StackOverflow question - but don't cross-post just because your question is down-voted or put on hold for being unclear."
Recommended additional R resources include: All alternative R engines have the goal of increasing R's performance and memory management.
"Due to R's simple name, questions sometimes get tagged with the r tag when a different topic is meant."
Here is a list of tags that mistagged R questions might be re-tagged to
" Node.js is an event-based, non-blocking, asynchronous"
I/O runtime that uses Google's V8 JavaScript engine and libuv library.
/O runtime that uses Google's V8 JavaScript engine and libuv library
"is used for developing applications that make heavy use of the ability to run JavaScript both on the client, as well as on server side and therefore benefit from the re-usability of code and the lack of context switching.  "
"Node.js is an event-based, non-blocking, asynchronous"
I/O (input/output) runtime that uses Google's V8 JavaScript Engine.  
"Node.js, commonly just called Node, is often used for developing applications that rely on the ability to run javascript both on the client and server side."
Running the same language on both the client and the server benefits from improved code reusability and the less context switching.
"A notable feature of  Node.js is that it is non-blocking C if one task stalls or pauses for an I/O operation, another can take over while it is idle."
This allows for high efficiency as the program as a whole never has to idle and wait for one task to finish.
Libraries such as async take advantage of this capability.
More information's also possible to use mature JavaScript frameworks like YUI and jQuery for server-side DOM manipulation in  Node.js.
"To ease the development of complex JavaScript further,  Node.js supports the CommonJS standard that allows for modularized development and the distribution of software in packages via the Node Package Manager (NPM)."
" ASP.NET is a Microsoft web application development framework that allows programmers to build dynamic web sites, web applications and web services.  "
"ASP.NET is useful to use this tag in conjunction with the project type tag e.g. [asp.net-mvc],"
ASP.NET was first released in January 2002 with version 1.0 of the .NET Framework and is the successor to Microsoft's Active Server Pages (ASP) technology.  
"ASP.NET is built on the Common Language Runtime ([tag: CLR]), allowing programmers to write ASP.NET code using any supported .NET language."
"Typically,  ASP.NET uses a WebForms style of development, which was also the original method of developing web applications in  ASP.NET."
Web forms are a model which mimics the control/event model of classic WinForms development providing the illusion of stateful pages.
"In March of 2009, Microsoft released version 1.0 of the ASP.NET MVC Framework."
"As an alternative model to web forms, the .NET Framework applies the Model-View-Controller pattern to web applications in  ASP.NET."
"As  ASP.NET includes  ASP.NET own controls library for web forms, wrapping HTML controls and adding functionality to HTML controls, any ASP.NET controls have as markup <asp:ctrl_name></asp:ctrl_name>."
"For  ASP.NETMVC, instead of a control library there exist HTML helper methods which make it easier to blend HTML markup with code, while allowing developers to create views in mostly pure HTML."
"The original one is webforms-view-engine and uses .aspx and .ascx files for views and partial views, respectively."
"The other, newer one is Razor, which focuses on developer productivity by providing more concise and less obtrusive syntax."
It is useful to use this tag in conjunction with the project type tag

" An array is an ordered linear data structure consisting of a collection of elements (values, variables, or references), each identified by one or more indexes."
"When asking about specific variants of arrays, use these related tags instead: [vector], [arraylist], [matrix]."
"When using this tag, in a question that is specific to a programming language, tag the question with the programming language being used."
"An array is an ordered linear data structure consisting of a collection of elements (values or variables), each identified by at least one index, stored in contiguous memory locations."
An array is typically stored so that the position of each element can be computed from its index tuple by a mathematical formula.
"In some languages (C, Java, etc.) the length of the array must be set beforehand."
"In other languages (Ruby, Python, LISP, Haxe, etc.)"
the length of the array grows dynamically as elements are added.
"When tagging a question with this tag, also tag the question with the programming language being used."
"Elements of an array are usually specified with a 0-first index, for example, myarray[0] would represent the first element of myarray. "
(where n is the length of the array minus 1) would represent the last element in the array. 
"However, some languages such as old Fortran and Lua use 1 as the initial index."
"Some languages (C++, Java, C#) have \"basic arrays\" and collections. "
"Basic arrays are supported by the compiler directly, have a fixed size, and only provide element access by index. "
"Collections, like Java's ArrayList, are system library classes implemented on the top of these basic arrays and have a wide range of various methods. "
"In such cases, Basic arrays should be used to name these basic arrays ."
these basic arrays  can be statically allocated or dynamically allocated. 
The way in which you access the array and its type varies based on how its is declared and allocated.
"For example, an array with one index (e.g. array[0]) is known as a one-dimensional array. "
If an array with one index (e.g. array[0])  has two indices (e.g. array[0][0])
an array with one index (e.g. array[0])  is considered two dimensional and maybe visualized as a grid. 
"Multidimensional arrays, or, in other words, arrays with multiple indices are called matrices, or a matrix is singular."
"Where talking about specific variants of arrays, use these related tags instead:"
" C is a general-purpose programming language used for system programming (OS and embedded), libraries, games and cross-platform."
"This tag should be used with general questions concerning the C language, as defined in the ISO 9899 standard (the latest version, 9899:2018, unless otherwise specified ― also tag version-specific requests with c89, c99, c11, etc).  "
C is distinct from C++ and  C should not be combined with the C++ tag absent a rational reason.
"C (pronounced \"See\", like the letter C) is a general-purpose computer programming language developed between 1969 and 1973 by Dennis Ritchie at the Bell Telephone Laboratories for use with the UNIX operating system."
"a general-purpose computer programming language developed between 1969 and 1973 by Dennis Ritchie at the Bell Telephone Laboratories for use with the UNIX operating system design provides constructs that map efficiently to typical machine instructions, and therefore a general-purpose computer programming language developed between 1969 and 1973 by Dennis Ritchie at the Bell Telephone Laboratories for use with the UNIX operating system found lasting use in applications that had formerly been coded in assembly language."
a general-purpose computer programming language developed between 1969 and 1973 by Dennis Ritchie at the Bell Telephone Laboratories for use with the UNIX operating system is a highly efficient procedural programming language and has an emphasis on functions whereas modern object-oriented programming languages tend to emphasize data.
"The C programming language was based on the earlier programming languages B, BCPL, and CPL."
"The C language and The C programming language optional library are standardized as ISO/IEC 9899, the current version being ISO/IEC 9899:2018 (C17)."
"Although C was designed for implementing system software, A draft version N2176 is also widely used for developing portable application software."
C is one of the most widely used programming languages of all time and there are very few computer architectures for which a C compiler does not exist.
"C has greatly influenced many other popular programming languages, most notably C++, which began as an extension to C. Other languages that have been greatly influenced by C are C#, Objective-C and Java."
C is an imperative (procedural) systems implementation language.
"C was designed to be compiled using a relatively straightforward compiler, to provide low-level access to memory, to provide language constructs that map efficiently to machine instructions, and to require minimal run-time support."
"C was, therefore, useful for many applications that had formerly been coded in assembly language."
"Despite its low-level capabilities, assembly language was designed to encourage cross-platform programming."
A standards-compliant and portably written C program can be compiled for a very wide variety of computer platforms and operating systems with very few changes to its source code.
"assembly language has become available on a very wide range of platforms, from embedded microcontrollers to supercomputers."

JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a serializable data interchange format intended to be machine-
"JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is defined by RFC 7159 which is completely language independent, but  JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) uses conventions familiar to programmers of the C-family of languages, including c, c++, c#, java, javascript, perl, python, and many others."
These properties make  JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) an ideal data-interchange language to use with RESTful APIs or ajax.
These properties is often used instead of xml because of These properties lightweight and compact structure.
Many programming languages provide methods for parsing a JSON-formatted text string into a native object and vice versa.
"For example, JavaScript in modern browsers and other environments includes the methods JSON.parse()"
"The JSON format is based on two types of structures: An ordered list of values (more commonly referred to as an array)  JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) defines six types of values: null, numbers, strings, booleans, arrays and objects."
"With regard to objects, the order of members is not significant, and the behavior of a JSON parser when duplicate member names are encountered is undefined."
Note that  JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is not the same thing as JavaScript object literals.
"Rather,  JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a common format to serialize from and deserialize to objects in most languages."
"For more information, see There is no such thing as a  JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) object in JavaScript."
"Shortly after it was created,  JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) validation was added following the description set out by Douglas Crockford of json.org in RFC 4627."
JSON validation has since been expanded to also validate both current competing JSON standards RFC 7159 and ECMA-404.

React uses a virtual DOM diff implementation for ultra-high performance.
a virtual DOM diff implementation for ultra-high performance can also render on the server using node.js ― a heavy browser DOM isn't required.
"Further, there is a React-Native offshoot for using React on mobile devices such as ios and android."
React implements one-way reactive data flow using props which reduce boilerplate and is easier to understand than traditional two-way data binding.
React creates a virtual DOM so that all the components can be re-rendered individually without the need for the whole page to be repainted by the browser
"A user can update a particular content of the page just by re-rendering only that component React's view logic means it can easily render on the server, in the browser or native components React can be used in conjunction with frameworks like angular.js and backbone.js Separating the declarative view (jsx) and logic make projects easier to read and maintain"

Objective-C is an object-oriented programming language combining features of C (c) and Smalltalk (smalltalk).
"It is a strict superset of C (any valid C code is equally valid Objective-C code, with the minor exception that id is a free identifier for user use in C while it is a keyword in Objective-C), and it inherits it object-oriented capabilities from Smalltalk."
"All procedural syntax is identical to that of C, and all object-oriented syntax is an implementation of Smalltalk messaging."
Objective-C was created primarily by Brad Cox and Tom Love in the early 1980s at their company Stepstone.
"Objective-C is now primarily developed by Apple, Objective-C is a general-purpose, high-level, object-oriented programming language that adds Smalltalk-style messaging to the C programming language."
"It is the main programming language used by Apple for macos and ios and macos and ios respective APIs, cocoa and cocoa-touch."
"Objective-C inherits the syntax, primitive types, and flow control statements of C and adds syntax for defining classes and methods."
"Objective-C also adds language-level support for object graph management and object literals while providing dynamic typing and binding, deferring many responsibilities until run time."
"Objective-C is a thin layer on top of C, and moreover is a strict superset of C; it is possible to compile any C program with an Objective-C compiler, and to freely include C code within an Objective-C class."
Objective-C derives Objective-C object syntax from Smalltalk.
"All of the syntax for non-object-oriented operations (including primitive variables, pre-processing, expressions, function declarations, and function calls) is identical to that of C, while the syntax for object-oriented features is an implementation of Smalltalk-style messaging."
Objective-C has many powerful features as detailed below:

"Some of these changes are backwards incompatible, and therefore Python 3 has Python 3 own tag."
"Although Python 3 is now the recommended and supported version of the language, some users still remain on version 2.7 for various reasons."
"If you start new projects or begin to learn Python, version 3 is now the recommended target under normal circumstances: Python 3 is strongly recommended for any new development."
"As of January 2020, Python 2 has reached End Of Life status, meaning Python 2 will receive no further updates or bugfixes, including for security issues."
Many frameworks and other add on projects are following a similar policy.

 Regular expressions provide a declarative language to match patterns within strings.  
"Regular expressions are commonly used for string validation, parsing, and transformation."
"Because regular expressions are not fully standardized, all questions with this tag should also include a tag specifying the applicable programming language or tool."
Requests to explain a regular expression pattern or construct will be closed as duplicates of the canonical post What does this regex mean which contains a lot of details on regular expression constructs.
the canonical post also contains links to many popular online regular expression testers (where the meanings of regex constructs can be found).
Regular expressions are a powerful formalism for pattern matching in strings.
"Regular expressions are available in a variety of dialects (also known as flavors) in a number of programming languages and text-processing tools, as well as many specialized applications.  "
The term \"Regular expression\" is typically abbreviated as \"RegEx\" or \"regex\".
"Before asking a question here, please take the time to review the following brief guidelines."
"Always indicate which platform you need or want to use (programming language, tool, occasionally even version information).  "
"Keep in mind that regex dialects are different; the lowest common denominator will usually be quite different from what is possible and recommended for a tool with a modern, souped-up regex engine."
"If your question relates to regular expressions in the strict computer science/automata theory sense, please state this explicitly."
"For most other questions, you should always include sample input, expected output, and an outline of what you have tried, and where you are stuck.  "
"Often, an example of what you do not want to match is also very helpful, and important to know."
A link to one of the many online regex testing tools (see link section) with your attempt and some representative data can do wonders.
"Even if you cannot post your problem online, showing us your attempt helps us focus on what you need help with."
"Before posting, check if your issue has already been solved by somebody else asking something similar."
The following section outlines some common recurring topics.
Do not assume that the tool you are using supports precisely the syntax of another tool.
"If your question is not specific to any particular implementation, try the language-agnostic tag."
"This will generally imply a fairly minimal set of operators, corresponding to the ones specified in the common mathematical definition of regular languages."
Understand the difference between \"glob\" expressions and true regular expressions.
"Glob patterns are a less potent pattern matching language, which is commonly used for file name wildcards."
"In glob, * means \"anything\", while a lone * in a regular expression is, in fact, a syntax error in some dialects (though many engines will silently ignore it, rather than issue a warning; and others still will see it as a literal *)."
"For the record, the regex way to say (as much as possible of) \"anything\" is ."
"* where the \"any single character (except newline, usually)\" ."
But see below about how \"any character\" and greediness is often problematic.
Using {1} as a single-repetition quantifier is harmless but never useful.
It is basically an indication of inexperience and/or confusion.
h{1}t{1}t{1}p{1} matches the same string as the simpler expression http (or
"but as you can see, the redundant {1} repetitions only make it harder to read."
Square brackets are commonly misunderstood or misused.
"Beginners often attempt to use square brackets for everything, including grouping."
"While [Jun][Jul] may look like a regex for matching months, it actually matches JJ, Ju, Jl, uJ, uu, ul, nJ, nu, or nl;"
not Jun or Jul. [Jun|Jul] is a wasteful way to write the functionally identical
"any one character from the set comprising |, J, u, l, and n."
"For the record, [abc] defines a character class  which matches a single character which can be a or b or c."
"The proper way to express alternation is (Jun|Jul|Aug) in many dialects (though BRE and related dialects will need backslashes; \(Jun\|Jul\|Aug\) for traditional grep et al.) or, somewhat more parsimoniously, (Ju[nl]|Aug) Related to the previous, beginners will use negated character classes to attempt to restrict what can be matched."
"For example, to match turn but not turned, the following does not do what you want: turn[^ed] -- the following will match turn followed by any single character which is not e or d (so the following will not match turner, for example)."
"Notice also how the character class negation operator is distinct from the beginning of line anchor (^[abc] matches a, b, or c at beginning of the line, whereas [^abc] matches a single character which is not a, b, or c)."
"If there is a way to match, the engine will find the engine."
The regex a.*b will match the entire string \"abbbbbb\" because * will always match as much as possible.
"Say a[^ab]*b if that's what you mean, or use non-greedy matching if your dialect supports it."
"If you use grouping parentheses, grouping parentheses define what is captured into a backreference.  "
"If you edit in parentheses for grouping purposes, make sure you are not renumbering your backreferences."
"Also, in particular, watch out for (abc){2,3} which only captures the last occurrence of abc in the matched string.  "
"If you want the repetition to be part of the capture, you want the repetition to be part of the capture needs to be inside the parentheses, like this: ((abc){2,3})"
"In particular, using (typically line-oriented) traditional regex tools to handle structured formats like HTML, XML, JSON, configuration files with block structure (Apache, nginx, many name servers, etc.) is likely to fail, or to produce incorrect results in numerous corner cases."
Asking for HTML regexes tends to be met with negative reactions.

"Regular expressions are useful in a wide variety of text processing tasks, and more generally string processing, where the data need not be textual."
"Common applications include data validation, data scraping (especially web scraping), data wrangling, simple parsing, the production of syntax highlighting systems, and many other tasks."
"While regular expressions would be useful on Internet search engines, processing regular expressions across the entire database could consume excessive computer resources depending on the complexity and design of the regex."
"Although in many cases system administrators can run regex-based queries internally, most search engines do not offer regex support to the public."
"Notable exceptions: searchcode, or previously Google Code Search, which has been shut down in 2012. "

 AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML) is a technique for creating interactive website user interfaces without the traditional web page refresh or reload.  
AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML) uses asynchronous data exchange between client and server to update displayed information and respond to user interactions seamlessly.
"Include additional tags for programming languages, libraries, frameworks, web browser, protocols and other environmental information."
"While not a technology in AJAX, AJAX is a term coined in 2005 by Jesse James Garrett, that described an approach to using a number of existing technologies together, including: html / xhtml, css, javascript, the dom, xml, xslt, and most importantly the XMLHttpRequest object."
AJAX uses the XMLHttpRequest (abbreviated xhr) API to manage http requests from inside the code.
What makes AJAX so useful is the asynchronous nature of the data exchange.
"Prior to AJAX advent, data was only sent during the client communication phase (when the web page is first requested)."
This meant that all data had to either be loaded when the web page was requested or the user interaction would be a series of HTML requests to the server with page refreshes.
Each HTML request would provide additional information as part of the URL or as data in a form field with state data often kept as hidden field data.
"This second alternative used a series of GET or POST operations (i.e., load page, change data, post data, load page, etc.)"
"resulting in the displayed page being refreshed, providing a choppy user experience and possible security issues."
Neither loading an entire data set into the client nor reloading the base page with each GET or POST request was cheap in terms of resources.
ajax changed the web model by using JavaScript to asynchronously load data into the client as an entire data set into the client nor reloading the base page with each GET or POST request was needed.
The XMLHttpRequest object is the main method of interacting with the server and the client; ajax is supported by all modern browsers.
"There are a number of frameworks and libraries with a higher level API that encapsulate the XMLHttpRequest object, providing an easier interface to hide the complexity of using the object directly."
"The client opens a new XMLHttpRequest and requests a web page, just like a normal client call would."
"This request, however, is typically aimed at a special page that loads only data to be processed by JavaScript."
"As such, the data that needs to be exchanged can be limited to just what is necessary for that particular function, saving time, memory and bandwidth."
"Because it is asynchronous, this interaction does not have to block any other actions being done on the web page, and it lets the client/browser act more like a local, desktop program with the website, exchanging data as needed without reloading any other resources."
"Although the \"X\" in ajax stands for xml, any type of data can be sent and received."
json (JavaScript Object Notation) has replaced xml as the data interchange format of choice.
"A major reason for using json (JavaScript Object Notation) is that JavaScript natively parses json (JavaScript Object Notation) text, while XML must be parsed by a much slower and cumbersome set of client libraries."
"Today, with the help of new responseType objects (ArrayBuffer, Blob, etc.), you can even request binary files via XMLHttpRequest, and build much stronger and fully-featured web apps."
"When XMLHttpRequest is used directly, the code must handle the communications layer and wait for the request-response to be complete."
This is shown in the code example below starting with the line if (xmlhttp.readyState == 4 && xmlhttp.status == 200).
"Since this callback function will be called every time the client receives a packet from the server, this test is needed to make sure the request state is complete and a valid 200 response is received before processing a valid 200 response."
"Because needing to test the status adds some complexity to ajax, there are many javascript libraries that will handle this interaction for you."
"Below is an example of using a common library, jquery and shows how it simplifies ajax As of Chrome 42, Edge 14 and Firefox 39/52 there is a new API called fetch that drastically simplifies ajax in browsers."
Axios is a Promise based HTTP client for the browser and Node JS.
"Use this tag only if your question relates to programming using Linux APIs or Linux-specific behavior, not just because you happen to run your code on Linux."

"is a Unix-like computer operating system which consists of necessary user-space libraries and programs provided by GNU in Cambridge, Massachusetts and a kernel, developed by Linus Torvalds in Helsinki, Finland."
The GNU/Linux naming controversy is a dispute among members of the free and open-source software community over how to refer to the computer operating system commonly called linux.
A GNU/Linux-based system is a modular Unix-like operating system.
A GNU/Linux-based system derives much of A GNU/Linux-based system basic design from principles established in Unix during the 1970s and 1980s.
"Such a system uses a monolithic kernel that handles process control, networking, and peripheral and file system access."
Device drivers are either integrated directly with the kernel or added as modules loaded while Such a system is running.
Separate projects that interface with the kernel provide much of Such a system's higher-level functionality.
"The GNU user land is an important part of most GNU/Linux-based systems, providing the most common implementation of the C library, a popular shell, and many of the common Unix tools which carry out many basic operating system tasks."
The graphical user interface (or GUI) used by most GNU/Linux systems is built on top of an implementation of the X Window System.
The linux tag on Stack Overflow is generally used for questions about:
"Notable questions that probably don't belong are: Many questions about GNU/Linux can also be properly tagged as Unix, but some features are specific to GNU/Linux and are not found on other Unix64 and Unix-like operating systems."
"If you have questions about a specific distribution and version (e.g., ubuntu-14.04, it may not be necessary to use The linux tag on Stack Overflow for that question."
"A fair number of GNU/Linux questions are questions about the command shell (bash by default on many systems), and are probably better tagged with shell"
"and/or the particular shell you are interested in (bash, zsh, tcsh, etc.)."
Questions about the internals of the GNU/Linux kernel or regarding writing GNU/Linux kernel modules should be tagged linux-kernel.

 XML (Extensible Markup Language) is a structured document format defining text encoding rules.
"When using this tag include additional tags such as programming language, tool sets, XML technologies being used, and other tags describing the environment of the problem posted."
XML flexibility lends to a wide variety of uses for human and machine data transfer so be specific as to tools and libraries.  
XML (Extensible Markup Language) is a set of rules for encoding documents in both human-readable and machine-readable form.  
"XML (Extensible Markup Language) is defined in the XML 1.0 Specification produced by the W3C, and several other related specifications, all gratis open standards.  "
XML (Extensible Markup Language) lets you define your own tags.
Markup - The most attractive feature of  XML (Extensible Markup Language) has to be Markup - ability to allow Markup - user to create their own tags.
The tags that can be created will be similar to tags in HTML.
But with  XML (Extensible Markup Language) you are afforded the opportunity to define your own tags.
Language - XML is a language that is very similar to HTML.
But Language - XML’s much more flexible because Language - XML allows creating custom tags.
In this way XML acts like a meta-language: a language that allows us to create or define other languages.
"For example, with XML we can create other languages, such as RSS."
"The design goals of XML emphasize simplicity, generality, and usability over the Internet."
The design goals of XML is a textual data format with strong support via Unicode for the languages of the world.
"Although the design of Language - XML focuses on documents, the design of XML is widely used for the representation of arbitrary data structures C for example in web services, configuration/settings, and GUI, workflow, and task definition."
XML is also used in some protocols for distributed computing and web services such as SOAP and HTML-RPC and REST (see also SOAP vs REST (differences) )
"Many application programming interfaces (APIs) have been developed to aid software developers with processing XML data, and several schema languages exist to aid in the definition of XML-based languages."
"Schemas are usually defined with an external namespace, but XML also allows you to define tags within the document itself."
XML was introduced in 1996 as version 1.0 and has reached version 1.1 in 2004 which has some unique features but isn't very widely spread.
"As already stated, the structure of XML is very similar to the structure of HTML."
"That is, an XML document is a tree structure with the nodes being called tags (similar to HTML elements), and if T2 is descendant of tag T1, then T2 is inside T1."
Notable changes from XML include: XML is forward compatible with the Unicode standard.
The following text is defined using XHTML and entity references; the text serves as an example of XML syntax and structure: The following links provide additional information to learn about XML: sgml html xhtml xquery xpath xslt xlink xpointerxml-parsing
