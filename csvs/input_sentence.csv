 For questions regarding programming in ECMAScript (JavaScript/JS) and its various dialects/implementations (excluding ActionScript).
"Please include all relevant tags on your question; e.g., [node.js], [jquery], [json], etc."
"JavaScript (a dialect of ECMAScript) is a high-level, dynamic, multi-paradigm, object-oriented, prototype-based, weakly-typed, and interpreted language traditionally used for client-side scripting in web browsers."
"JavaScript (a dialect of ECMAScript) can also be run outside of the browser with the use of a framework like Node.js, Nashorn, Wakanda, or Google Apps Script."
"Despite the name, it is unrelated to the Java programming language and shares only superficial similarities."
"Unless a tag for a framework or library is also included, a pure JavaScript (a dialect of ECMAScript) answer is expected for questions with the javascript tag."
"JavaScript (a dialect of ECMAScript) runs on nearly every operating system, and an engine is included in mainstream web browsers."
"Developed in 1995 by Brendan Eich at Netscape Communications, JavaScript (a dialect of ECMAScript) was originally called LiveScript but was renamed to JavaScript (a dialect of ECMAScript) due to Netscape's friendly relationship with Sun Microsystems (creators of Java) at the time."
"Standalone JavaScript (a dialect of ECMAScript) engines or interpreters are available as well, including: The Mozilla Developer Network contains high-quality documentation on JavaScript (a dialect of ECMAScript)."
JavaScript (a dialect of ECMAScript) is typically used to manipulate the Document Object Model (DOM) and Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) within the browser.
"This allows user interface scripting, animation, automation, client-side validation, and much more."
"With the recent emergence of platforms such as Node.js, JavaScript (a dialect of ECMAScript) can now be used to write server-side applications."
"In addition, The Mozilla Developer Network is also used in environments that aren't web-based, like PDF documents, site-specific browsers, desktop widgets, etc."
"Although The Mozilla Developer Network was developed under the name Mocha, the language was officially called LiveScript when the language first shipped in beta releases of Netscape Navigator 2.0 in September 1995, but the language was renamed JavaScript (a dialect of ECMAScript) when the language was deployed in the Netscape browser version 2.0B3."
The change of name from LiveScript to JavaScript (a dialect of ECMAScript) roughly coincided with Netscape adding support for Java technology in Netscape Netscape Netscape Navigator 2.0 web browser.
"The final choice of name caused confusion, giving the impression that the language was a spin-off of the Java programming language, and the choice has been characterized as a marketing ploy by Netscape to give JavaScript the cachet of what was then the hot, new web-programming language."
The language and the term originated from Netscape.
"ECMAScript, JavaScript, and JScript are terms that are easy to confuse."
ECMAScript was developed as a standardization of Netscape's JavaScript and Microsoft's independently-developed JScript.
The canonical reference is the ECMAScript03 2015 Language Specification.
"While JavaScript and JScript aim to be compatible with ECMAScript, JavaScript and JScript also provide additional features (and other deviations) not described in the ECMA specifications."
The differences today for those who use JavaScript are negligible; people generally do not distinguish the JavaScript and JScript variations from ECMAScript.
"Most modern browsers implement JavaScript based on the ECMAScript 6 specification, although some fail to implement some ES6 features."
"However, older browsers such as Internet Explorer 8 implement the ECMAScript 3 specification, which does not contain functions such as Function.prototype.bind, and even JSON.parse, among others."
"You can see the current browser support of ES6 features The current version of ECMAScript is ECMAScript 10, properly known as ECMAScript 2019, which was finalized in June 2019."
JavaScript and the DOM provide the potential for malicious authors to deliver scripts to run on a client computer via the Web.
Browser authors contain this risk using two restrictions.
"First, scripts run in a sandbox in which scripts can only perform web-related actions, not general-purpose programming tasks like creating files."
"Second, scripts are constrained by the same-origin policy:"
"scripts from one Web site do not have access to information such as usernames, passwords, or cookies sent to another site."
Most JavaScript-related security bugs are breaches of either the same origin policy or the sandbox.
Content Security Policy is the main intended method of ensuring that only trusted code is executed on a Web page.
XSS is a frequent type of attempting to steal data or harm a website via JavaScript.

"Java is a high-level, platform-independent, object-oriented, functional programming language and runtime environment."
"The Java language derives much of  Java syntax from C and C++, but  Java object model is simpler than that of the latter and  Java has fewer low-level facilities."
Java applications are typically compiled to bytecode (called class files) that can be executed by The JVM.
The JVM often further compiles code to native machine code to optimize performance.
The JVM manages memory with the help of a garbage collector (see garbage-collection) in order to handle object removal from memory when objects are no longer in use.  
"Java's typing discipline is static, strong, safe, nominative, and manifest.  "
Java supports features such as reflection and interfacing with C and C++ via the JNI (Java Native Interface).  
"Java is designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible, intended to allow application developers to write once, run anywhere, or sometimes write once, run everywhere (code that executes on one platform does not need to be recompiled to run on another).  "
"Java was originally developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems (which fully merged with Oracle Corporation on January 27th, 2010) and was released in 1995 as a core component of Sun Microsystems'  Java platform.  "
Java was started as a project called \"Oak\" by James Gosling in June 1991.
The  Java platform is the name given by Sun (now Oracle) to computing systems that have installed tools for developing and running  Java programs.
The Java platform features a wide variety of tools that can help developers work efficiently with the  Java programming language.
"To get started, you download a Java Development Kit (JDK), which lets you both develop and run  Java applications."
"The main reference implementation of  Java is open source (the OpenJDK) and is supported by major companies including Oracle, Apple, SAP, and IBM."
Very few computers can run  Java programs directly.  
Java apps intended to run directly on client computers should ship with Java apps own installers.
"Prior to java9, you asked end users to install a so-called JRE; however, this concept has been deprecated).  "
"Java is compiled into bytecode, which is then compiled by the JVM into native machine code."
"This was initially viewed as a performance hit, but JVM and just-in-time (JIT) compilation improvements have made this less of a concern."
"In some cases, the JVM JVM may even be faster than native code compiled to target an older version of a processor for backward-compatibility reasons."
"Since  Java,  Java can be compiled ahead-of-time (AOT)."
"Notable  Java versions, code names (in the [] brackets), and release dates (in the parentheses) include: Since Java SE 10, new versions will be released every six months."
"For more code names and release dates, visit Java SE Code Names."
"To see release notes for each version of the JDK, visit the Wikipedia article on  Java version history."
"java code on your machine, you need a java installer package supplier.  "
"Java is open source, but a supplier will take care of building the java source code into a binary, wrapping this into an installer, and maintaining this version on your machine (e.g. with security updates).  "
Java comes in LTS (Long-Term-Support) and non-LTS versions.
Each supplier chooses how to deal with LTS versions.
"Some (Oracle OpenJDK) have the same short support window for all releases, LTS or not."
Some (Amazon Coretto) do not bother to release non-LTS versions at all.
Most suppliers release all versions that will support LTS versions for far longer.

"Unlike many other languages,  Python uses an indentation-based syntax (in which tabs and spaces are noninterchangeable)."
This may take some getting used to for programmers who are familiar with using braces.
"To help with the transition, using a properly configured text-editor or IDE is recommended."
"Python comes with a basic IDE called IDLE (python-idle), to get you started."
"Other popular examples are the charityware Vim, the free GNU Emacs, Eclipse+PyDev, or PyCharm."

Questions regarding  HTML (HyperText Markup Language) should include a minimal reproducible example and some idea of what you're trying to achieve.
This tag is rarely used alone and is often paired with [CSS] and [javascript].
HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the markup language used for structuring web pages and other information to be displayed in a web browser.
"HTML describes the structure of a web-page semantically along with cues for presentation, making HTML a markup language rather than a programming language."
"A browser 'renders' HTML in conjunction with CSS, which defines the 'style' (colors, fonts, layout, etc.) and JavaScript, which defines interactive and dynamic elements, adding style and behavior to the pages."
https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/ is the canonical HTML specification.  
HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the main markup language for creating web pages and other information to be displayed to humans in a web-browser.  
HTML (HyperText Markup Language) was invented by Sir Tim Berners-Lee while developing the first Web browser at CERN to enable researchers to share researchers findings and formally released in June 1993.
The original \"HTML Tags\" were first publicly mentioned by Berners-Lee in 1991 and borrowed the syntax from CERN's SGML-based documentation standard.
The latest version for  HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is HTML5.2.
HTML elements form the building blocks of all web-pages.  
HTML (HyperText Markup Language) allows images and objects to be embedded in a page.  
HTML (HyperText Markup Language) references styles and scripts and carries meta-data.  
HTML (HyperText Markup Language) can be used to create interactive forms.  
"HTML (HyperText Markup Language) provides a means to create structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes and other items.  "
"HTML (HyperText Markup Language) can embed scripts written in languages such as JavaScript, which affects the behavior of HTML web pages."
"Web pages written in different programming languages (PHP, JSP, VF, ASP.NET etc.)"
HTML is a hierarchical (tree-structured) markup language.
"That is, an item might be a descendant of another item, which is its ancestor."
"However, if item2 is a descendant of item1, then they have an additional special relation:"
"item2 is inside of item1, or item1 is wrapped around"
"item2. HTML is written in the form of elements consisting of tags (and their attributes) enclosed in angle brackets (e.g., <html>)."
"The first is known as the opening tag and the second, which includes a forward slash, as the closing tag (e.g., <h1> and </h1>)."
"Various types of content, such as text or additional HTML elements, can be contained within these tags."
"Some tags, however, are unpaired, and these are known as empty elements or self-closing tags."
"these may or may not include the slash (e.g., <img> or <img />)."
"Web browsers read these documents, interpret each of the HTML tags, and then render Web browsers corresponding visual and/or audible display in the form of a webpage."
"HTML standards, as well as those for many other web technologies, are maintained by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)."
"HTML4 was introduced in 1997, and the latest iteration, HTML5, was recently developed by the W3C."
"What W3C calls HTML5 is a subset, with a few modifications, of the HTML-Living-Standard which is specified by the Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group (WHATWG)."
The language specification and standards documents for HTML5 are available online.
"HTML markups are designed, or 'styled', via CSS (Cascading Style Sheets), using one or more of the following: Dynamic and interactive parts of a page are programmed most frequently via JavaScript, using one or more of the following:"
" jQuery is a JavaScript library, consider also adding the JavaScript tag.    "
"jQuery is a popular cross-browser JavaScript library that facilitates Document Object Model (DOM) traversal, event handling, animations and AJAX interactions by minimizing the discrepancies across browsers."
"A question tagged  jQuery should be related to  jQuery, so  jQuery should be used by the code in question and at least jQuery usage-related elements need to be in the question.  "
"jQuery is a cross-browser JavaScript library (created by John Resig) that provides abstractions for common client-side tasks such as DOM traversal, DOM manipulation, event handling, animation and AJAX.  "
"jQuery simplifies HTML document traversal and manipulation, event handling, animation, and AJAX due to its API that works across a multitude of browsers.  "
jQuery provides a platform to create plugins that extend  jQuery capabilities beyond those already provided by the library.
The development of  jQuery and related projects is coordinated by the jQuery Foundation.
"jQuery supports the current stable version, and the preceding version or \"current - 1 version,\" of Chrome, Edge, Firefox, and Safari."
"the preceding version or \"current - 1 version,\" of Chrome, Edge, Firefox, and Safari also supports the current stable version of Opera."
"In addition,  jQuery supports Internet Explorer version 6 or higher."
"However, support for IE 6-8 was dropped by jQuery 2.x and by jQuery 3.x, which support only IE 9 or higher."
"Finally,  jQuery supports the stock mobile browser on Android 4.0 and higher, and Safari on iOS 7 and higher.  "
"jQuery is updated frequently, so the library should be used carefully."
Some functions become deprecated with newer versions of  jQuery.
Follow the release notes to be on track with the features.  
"jQuery provides download links for all versions of  jQuery, including the latest stable versions of each branch."
in the alert box on each link click after the DOM is ready (JSFiddle):
"If your code is somehow manipulating the DOM, then you need to ensure that your code is run after the DOM finishes loading."
jQuery provides ways to do that with an anonymous function: These are alternatives to placing the JavaScript code or script tag in the HTML right before the closing
"In  jQuery, the recommended way to add a ready handler is $(function () {}), while other forms such as $(document).ready(function () {}) are deprecated."
"Also, jQuery 3.x removes the ability to use .on(\"ready\", function () {}) to run a function on the \"ready\" event."
"If your jQuery code conflicts with another library that also uses the $ sign as an alias, then use the noConflict() method: Then you can safely use $ as an alias for the other library while using the name jQuery itself for jQuery functions."
"For example: It is also possible to assign jQuery to $ within a certain scope: Then you can use $ as an alias for jQuery inside that function block, without worrying about conflicts with other libraries."
Calling the jQuery function repeatedly is extremely inefficient.
Avoid doing this: Instead cache your jQuery object in a variable:
"Or better yet, use chaining to reduce repetition: Also, remember that many functions can perform multiple changes in one call, by grouping all the values into an object."
Instead of: jQuery wrapped variables are usually named starting with $ to distinguish jQuery wrapped variables from standard JavaScript objects.
"While one of the goals of jQuery is to abstract away the DOM, knowing DOM properties can be extremely useful."
"One of the most commonly made mistakes by those who learn jQuery without learning about the DOM is to utilize jQuery to access properties of an element: In the above code, this refers to the element from which the click event handler was fired."
"The code above is both slow and verbose; the code below functions identically and is much shorter, faster and more readable."
"Although the following two examples seem to be functionally equivalent and syntactically correct, the first example is preferred: By comparison, a string concatenation approach is much less readable and far more brittle: While the first example will be slower than the second, the benefits of greater clarity will likely outweigh the nominal speed differences in all but the most performance-sensitive applications."
"Moreover, the idiomatic syntax is robust against the injection of special characters."
"For instance, in the 2nd example, a quote character in variable would prematurely close the attributes."
Doing the proper encoding by yourself remains possible even if not recommended because it is prone to error.

"In 1998, the C++ Committee published the first international standard for C++ ISO/IEC 14882:1998, which would be informally known as C++98."
"In 2003, the C++ Committee responded to multiple problems that were reported with c++98, and revised it accordingly."
"The language standard remained pretty much the same for a long time, but in 2011 a new standard, C++11 (formerly known as C++0x) was published in ISO/IEC 14882:2011."
"Rather than in a \"big bang\" approach, it is being rolled out gradually as compilers are supporting the new language features."
"See Bjarne Stroustrup's C++11 FAQ to see what is new in The changed language, and check your own compiler's FAQ to see which of those features are currently supported: A few features that had been under discussion for C++11 have been deferred to the next iteration."
C++14 was approved in August 2014 and released in December of the same year.
Previously referred to as C++1y as the year of approval was uncertain.
Many popular compilers already have some level of C++14 support.
C++17 adds a few more major features (and several minor ones).
"It is usually referred to as C++1z or C++17, as technical work on the new standard was completed in March of 2017."
the new standard was approved (unanimously) by the ISO in September of 2017 and officially published in December 2017.
In February 2020 the C++ Standard committee completed work on C++20.
It was unanimously approved later that year and got officially published in December 2020.

" CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a representation style sheet language used for describing the look and formatting of HTML (HyperText Markup Language), XML (Extensible Markup Language) documents and SVG elements including (but not limited to) colors, layout, fonts, and animations.  "
"CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) also describes how elements should be rendered on screen, on paper, in speech, or on other media."
"CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, is a language used to control the visual presentation of documents written in a markup language, including HTML, XML, XHTML, SVG, and XUL."
"The visual presentation of HTML was originally defined by HTML attributes, but HTML 4 deprecated these attributes as CSS was introduced to separate the control of the visual presentation from content."
"In October 1994, H02kon Wium Lie first proposed Cascading HTML Style Sheets while working at CERN with Sir Tim Berners-Lee, who had been developing a web browser and inventing HTML."
"Each rule set starts with a selector, a pattern that matches elements in a HTML or XML document, and is followed by a block of zero or more property declarations that define the presentation of the matching elements."
The selector is quasi-identical to the selector used by Javascript's .querySelectorAll.
For example: example above also illustrates the cascading element of CSS.
"When you hover over a link (i.e., an <a> element) in an HTML page with this style sheet applied to this style sheet, both rules apply."
"Because of Each rule, the link will have a pink background."
"But, since the a:hover selector is more specific, the a:hover selector"
color and text-decoration properties override those from the <a> rule-set.
The cascading order defines how specificity and other factors determine which property value is applied to an element.
"Each component of a CSS selector can be based on one or more of four possible attributes of an HTML element: Selectors using an ID selector have higher priority than selectors using class names, and selectors using a class name have higher priority than selectors using tag names."
"important annotation can be used to override selector precedence, by elevating a normal declaration to an important declaration."
"Whenever possible, however, higher specificity within a normal declaration should be used in preference to the creation of an important declaration via the !important annotation, in order to prevent overrides on any other styles that might need to be added, particularly those that are subsequently added with a natural precedence intent."
"In the above example, the text color of the content of the <a> element, the string \"Sample\", will be green."
"Repeated occurrences of the same selector also increase specificity, as noted in the Selectors Level 3 W3C Recommendation."
"Here, the repeated selector has higher specificity than the singular selector, and the font-weight of our sample string will be bold."
Specificity is basically a measure of how specific a selector is ― how many elements a selector could match.
"Class selectors have a higher specificity, so [classes] will win against element selectors."
"ID selectors have an even higher specificity, so [IDs] will win against class selectors."
Complex selectors can be created by joining multiple simple ones together.
It is also possible to style elements depending on an attribute: A CSS rule specificity calculator is available here.
It may help when a project has one or multiple large CSS files.
Inheritance is the mechanism by which properties are applied not only to a specified element but also to Inheritance descendants.
"In general, descendant elements automatically inherit text-related properties, but box-related properties are not automatically inherited."
It is worth noting that any property can be inherited by using the inherit property value.
"This should be used with care, however, since Internet Explorer (up to and including version 7) doesn’t support this keyword."
"As an example: For questions related to CSS, try to demonstrate your code in a reproducible manner using either Stack Exchange's Stack Snippets or alternatively any online editor that allows running and sharing code such as JS Bin, JSFiddle or CodePen (though be sure to always include relevant code in the question)."

" iOS is the mobile operating system running on the Apple iPhone, iPod touch, and iPad."
Use this tag [ios] for questions related to programming on the iOS platform.
Use the related tags [objective-c] and [swift] for issues specific to those programming languages.  
iOS is a mobile operating system created and developed by Apple Inc. exclusively for  iOS hardware.  
"iOS is the operating system that presently powers many of  iOS's mobile devices, including the iPhone, iPad, and iPod Touch."
"the operating system that presently powers many of the company's mobile devices, including the iPhone, iPad, and iPod Touch should not be confused with i5/OS, which is one of IBM's operating systems for the IBM Power Systems (originally AS/400), or with Cisco's IOS (Inter-network Operating System).  "
"iOS Latest Stable Release:  iOS (18C66) released on December 14, 2020"
"iOS 14.4 beta 1 (18D5030e) released on December 16, 2020  iOS is a derivative of Apple's OSX desktop operating system, with which  iOS shares many (but not all) common frameworks and other components."
"These include Cocoa Touch (the counterpart of the OS X Cocoa UI Framework), the Mach/Darwin/XNU kernel and code from the Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD)."
Applications for  iOS are written for the Cocoa Touch framework (as opposed to OS X's Cocoa framework) using the same Xcode IDE for official use (i.e. for submitting applications to Apple's App Store) or using unofficial (mostly command-line only) toolchains for various operating systems (including Linux) for unofficial/jailbroken development.
"OS X is based on the Darwin-OS foundation, itself based on several Unix descendants."
"On June 2nd, 2014, Apple announced a new language, Swift, which could be used to develop apps for  iOS."
"Swift was in beta until September 9th, 2014, and is, since September 17th, 2018, at version 4.2.0."
"Each  iOS application runs in  iOS own secure sandbox to prevent (accidentally or intentionally) altering other applications, the operating system, or any other data."
"Since  iOS, an  iOS application can have extensions that extend custom functionality beyond the application.  "
"iOS is optimized for the power, graphics, processor, and memory constraints of mobile devices."
Interface is based on the concept of direct manipulation through multi-touch gestures.
"Interface control elements consist of sliders, switches, and buttons, all included in Apple's UIKit Framework."
"Interaction with the OS includes gestures such as swipe, tap, pinch, and reverse pinch, all of which have specific definitions within the context of the iOS operating system and iOS multi-touch interface."
Internal accelerometers and gyroscopes can be used by applications to respond to the user shaking the device (one application is the undo command) or rotating one application in three dimensions (one common result is switching from portrait to landscape mode or autorotation).
"Apple initially adapted features from OS X to create iOS, but that cycle is now bidirectional."
"Many features on the OS X 10.7 OSX Lion were implemented first in iOS, including application sandboxing, an OS X App Store (and the implied widespread third-party app code signing), the content-centric (\"natural\") scrolling direction, along with AV Foundation, Core Location, and a few other frameworks."
CocoaPods is a dependency manager for Swift and Objective-C Cocoa projects.
CocoaPods includes almost ten thousand libraries to help programmers scale projects.
"A popular alternative is Carthage, which is a decentralized dependency manager, meaning that CocoaPods does not store a central list of available projects."
Use the tag iOS for questions about Cisco's iOS operating system for Cisco network routers.
Before you ask about custom controls: I want this type of control.
"You will get lots of custom controls, animation, libraries and much more which is available in Swift and Objective-C. Before asking about a topic, just search it in  https://developer.apple.com/documentation/ also, which is the developer documentation provided by the apple which covers a lot of information regarding iOS development."

" MySQL is a free, open source Relational Database Management System (RDBMS) that uses Structured Query Language (SQL).  "
"DO NOT USE this tag for other DBs such as SQL Server, SQLite etc.  "
Those are different DBs which all use Those own dialects of SQL to manage the data.  
MySQL is an Open Source RDBMS (Relational Database Management System) that runs as a server providing multi-user access to a number of databases.  
MySQL source code is available under the GNU (General Public License).  
MariaDB is a fork of  MySQL using the same dialect of SQL and offering most of the same functions.
See mariadb for fork-specific questions and answers.  
MySQL offers standard database driver connectivity for using  MySQL with applications and tools that are compatible with industry standards ODBC and JDBC.
Please see this post: Tips for asking a good Structured Query Language (SQL) question to get tips on how to ask a question about  MySQL.
Following some of these steps will help people to help you solve your problem.
"Officially it is /ma010507skju090407l/ (\"My S-Q-L\"), but is often pronounced /ma0104si09kw05l/ (\"My Sequel\")."
Latest Version (MySQL Community Server 8.0.21) and Version History
 Structured Query Language (SQL) is a language for querying databases.
"Questions should include code examples, table structure, sample data, and a tag for the DBMS implementation (e.g. MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, MS SQL Server, IBM DB2, etc.)"
"If your question relates solely to a specific DBMS (uses specific extensions/features), use that DBMS's tag instead."
Answers to questions tagged with  Structured Query Language (SQL) should use ISO/IEC standard  Structured Query Language (SQL).
ISO/IEC standard SQL stands for Structured Query Language (informally) and usually pronounced as Sequel.
ISO/IEC standard SQL is based on relational algebra.
"In relational algebra, the word relation is synonymous with the word table."
ISO/IEC standard SQL is a standard to use relational algebra in a technical environment.
"One subset of the ISO/IEC standard SQL standard is DDL (Data Definition Language), which is used to create tables and constraints."
"Another subset is DML (Data Manipulation Language), which is used to modify and view data within the database: The final \"standard\" subset of commands is DCL (Data Control Language):"
"Many database implementations require the use of ISO/IEC standard SQL, and over the years, vendors have implemented dialects of ISO/IEC standard SQL to provide more functionality as well as simplify more functionality."
"Because of these deviations from the standard, ISO/IEC standard SQL is fractured C syntax that works on one implementation does not necessarily work on another."
"ISO/IEC (formerly ANSI) standards have been beneficial in resolving such situations, but adoption is selective."
"Queries conforming to ISO/IEC (formerly ANSI) standards should be portable to other databases, though performance may vary."
Most DBMSs have additional languages for writing stored procedures.
"In Oracle this is PL/SQL (Procedural Language/Structured Query Language), in PostgreSQL"
"Outside of stored procedures or functions, Oracle and PostgreSQL use ISO/IEC standard SQL."
Thus the tags plsql and plpgsql should only be used for problems directly related to writing stored procedures.
"Microsoft SQL Server uses the term T-SQL (Transact-SQL)(tsql) for both \"plain\" SQL (queries, DML, ..) and the language used for stored procedures."
"the mysql tag should be used for general SQL programming language questions, in addition to tags for specific products."
"For example, questions about Microsoft SQL Server should use the sql-server tag, while questions regarding MySQL should use the mysql tag."
"Microsoft SQL Server is the umbrella under which these products exist; tagging these products by product (including version, e.g oracle11g, sql-server-2008, hana) is the easiest way to know what functionality is available for the task at hand."
It is very common for MySQL questions to omit the mysql tag because query discussions on MySQL are more often stated as MySQL rather than SQL in general.
"Please read this summary about the SQL standard (the 1992 one in this case, broadly implemented) and if you can, refer to the book itself."
When you are asking a question about Microsoft SQL Server you can also add more specific tags.
Here is the list of available tags: You can specify your question by adding the implementation you used as a tag.
"While you should always provide complete code examples (e.g., schema, data sample and expected result) in your question or answer, you can also isolate problematic code and reproduce problematic code in an online environment:"
" R is a free, open-source programming language and software environment for statistical computing, bioinformatics, visualization, and general computing."
Please provide minimal and reproducible example(s) along with the desired output.
Use dput() for data and specify all non-base packages with library() calls.
"Do not embed pictures for data or code, use indented code blocks instead."
"For statistics related questions, use https://stats.stackexchange.com.  "
"R is a free, open-source programming language and software environment for statistical computing, bioinformatics, information graphics, and general computing."
It is a multi-paradigm language and dynamically typed.  
R is an implementation of the S programming language combined with lexical scoping semantics inspired by Scheme.  
R was created by Ross Ihaka and Robert Gentleman and is now developed by the R Development Core Team.
"The R environment is easily extended through a packaging system on CRAN, the Comprehensive R Archive Network."
"This tag should be used for programming-related questions about R. Including a minimal reproducible example in your question will increase your chances of getting a timely, useful answer."
Questions should not use This tag unless they relate specifically to the RStudio interface and not just the R language.
"If your question is more focused on statistics or data science, use Cross Validated or Data Science, respectively.  "
Bioinformatics-specific questions may be better received on Bioconductor Support or Biostars.
"General questions about R (such as requests for off-site resources or discussion questions) are unsuitable for StackOverflow and may be appropriate for one of the general, or special-interest, R mailing lists."
"Do research (read tag wikis, look at existing questions, or search online) to determine the most appropriate venue so that you have a better chance of receiving solutions to your question."
your question may be automatically migrated to a more appropriate StackExchange site.
"If you receive no response to your questions after a few days, or if your question is put on hold for being off-topic, it is then OK to post to another venue, giving a link to your StackOverflow question - but don't cross-post just because your question is down-voted or put on hold for being unclear."
Recommended additional R resources include: All alternative R engines have the goal of increasing R's performance and memory management.
"Due to R's simple name, questions sometimes get tagged with the r tag when a different topic is meant."
Here is a list of tags that mistagged R questions might be re-tagged to
" Node.js is an event-based, non-blocking, asynchronous"
I/O runtime that uses Google's V8 JavaScript engine and libuv library.
/O runtime that uses Google's V8 JavaScript engine and libuv library
"is used for developing applications that make heavy use of the ability to run JavaScript both on the client, as well as on server side and therefore benefit from the re-usability of code and the lack of context switching.  "
"Node.js is an event-based, non-blocking, asynchronous"
I/O (input/output) runtime that uses Google's V8 JavaScript Engine.  
"Node.js, commonly just called Node, is often used for developing applications that rely on the ability to run javascript both on the client and server side."
Running the same language on both the client and the server benefits from improved code reusability and the less context switching.
"A notable feature of  Node.js is that it is non-blocking C if one task stalls or pauses for an I/O operation, another can take over while it is idle."
This allows for high efficiency as the program as a whole never has to idle and wait for one task to finish.
Libraries such as async take advantage of this capability.
More information's also possible to use mature JavaScript frameworks like YUI and jQuery for server-side DOM manipulation in  Node.js.
"To ease the development of complex JavaScript further,  Node.js supports the CommonJS standard that allows for modularized development and the distribution of software in packages via the Node Package Manager (NPM)."
" ASP.NET is a Microsoft web application development framework that allows programmers to build dynamic web sites, web applications and web services.  "
"ASP.NET is useful to use this tag in conjunction with the project type tag e.g. [asp.net-mvc],"
ASP.NET was first released in January 2002 with version 1.0 of the .NET Framework and is the successor to Microsoft's Active Server Pages (ASP) technology.  
"ASP.NET is built on the Common Language Runtime ([tag: CLR]), allowing programmers to write ASP.NET code using any supported .NET language."
"Typically,  ASP.NET uses a WebForms style of development, which was also the original method of developing web applications in  ASP.NET."
Web forms are a model which mimics the control/event model of classic WinForms development providing the illusion of stateful pages.
"In March of 2009, Microsoft released version 1.0 of the ASP.NET MVC Framework."
"As an alternative model to web forms, the .NET Framework applies the Model-View-Controller pattern to web applications in  ASP.NET."
"As  ASP.NET includes  ASP.NET own controls library for web forms, wrapping HTML controls and adding functionality to HTML controls, any ASP.NET controls have as markup <asp:ctrl_name></asp:ctrl_name>."
"For  ASP.NETMVC, instead of a control library there exist HTML helper methods which make it easier to blend HTML markup with code, while allowing developers to create views in mostly pure HTML."
"The original one is webforms-view-engine and uses .aspx and .ascx files for views and partial views, respectively."
"The other, newer one is Razor, which focuses on developer productivity by providing more concise and less obtrusive syntax."
It is useful to use this tag in conjunction with the project type tag

" An array is an ordered linear data structure consisting of a collection of elements (values, variables, or references), each identified by one or more indexes."
"When asking about specific variants of arrays, use these related tags instead: [vector], [arraylist], [matrix]."
"When using this tag, in a question that is specific to a programming language, tag the question with the programming language being used."
"An array is an ordered linear data structure consisting of a collection of elements (values or variables), each identified by at least one index, stored in contiguous memory locations."
An array is typically stored so that the position of each element can be computed from its index tuple by a mathematical formula.
"In some languages (C, Java, etc.) the length of the array must be set beforehand."
"In other languages (Ruby, Python, LISP, Haxe, etc.)"
the length of the array grows dynamically as elements are added.
"When tagging a question with this tag, also tag the question with the programming language being used."
"Elements of an array are usually specified with a 0-first index, for example, myarray[0] would represent the first element of myarray. "
(where n is the length of the array minus 1) would represent the last element in the array. 
"However, some languages such as old Fortran and Lua use 1 as the initial index."
"Some languages (C++, Java, C#) have \"basic arrays\" and collections. "
"Basic arrays are supported by the compiler directly, have a fixed size, and only provide element access by index. "
"Collections, like Java's ArrayList, are system library classes implemented on the top of these basic arrays and have a wide range of various methods. "
"In such cases, Basic arrays should be used to name these basic arrays ."
these basic arrays  can be statically allocated or dynamically allocated. 
The way in which you access the array and its type varies based on how its is declared and allocated.
"For example, an array with one index (e.g. array[0]) is known as a one-dimensional array. "
If an array with one index (e.g. array[0])  has two indices (e.g. array[0][0])
an array with one index (e.g. array[0])  is considered two dimensional and maybe visualized as a grid. 
"Multidimensional arrays, or, in other words, arrays with multiple indices are called matrices, or a matrix is singular."
"Where talking about specific variants of arrays, use these related tags instead:"
" C is a general-purpose programming language used for system programming (OS and embedded), libraries, games and cross-platform."
"This tag should be used with general questions concerning the C language, as defined in the ISO 9899 standard (the latest version, 9899:2018, unless otherwise specified ― also tag version-specific requests with c89, c99, c11, etc).  "
C is distinct from C++ and  C should not be combined with the C++ tag absent a rational reason.
"C (pronounced \"See\", like the letter C) is a general-purpose computer programming language developed between 1969 and 1973 by Dennis Ritchie at the Bell Telephone Laboratories for use with the UNIX operating system."
"a general-purpose computer programming language developed between 1969 and 1973 by Dennis Ritchie at the Bell Telephone Laboratories for use with the UNIX operating system design provides constructs that map efficiently to typical machine instructions, and therefore a general-purpose computer programming language developed between 1969 and 1973 by Dennis Ritchie at the Bell Telephone Laboratories for use with the UNIX operating system found lasting use in applications that had formerly been coded in assembly language."
a general-purpose computer programming language developed between 1969 and 1973 by Dennis Ritchie at the Bell Telephone Laboratories for use with the UNIX operating system is a highly efficient procedural programming language and has an emphasis on functions whereas modern object-oriented programming languages tend to emphasize data.
"The C programming language was based on the earlier programming languages B, BCPL, and CPL."
"The C language and The C programming language optional library are standardized as ISO/IEC 9899, the current version being ISO/IEC 9899:2018 (C17)."
"Although C was designed for implementing system software, A draft version N2176 is also widely used for developing portable application software."
C is one of the most widely used programming languages of all time and there are very few computer architectures for which a C compiler does not exist.
"C has greatly influenced many other popular programming languages, most notably C++, which began as an extension to C. Other languages that have been greatly influenced by C are C#, Objective-C and Java."
C is an imperative (procedural) systems implementation language.
"C was designed to be compiled using a relatively straightforward compiler, to provide low-level access to memory, to provide language constructs that map efficiently to machine instructions, and to require minimal run-time support."
"C was, therefore, useful for many applications that had formerly been coded in assembly language."
"Despite its low-level capabilities, assembly language was designed to encourage cross-platform programming."
A standards-compliant and portably written C program can be compiled for a very wide variety of computer platforms and operating systems with very few changes to its source code.
"assembly language has become available on a very wide range of platforms, from embedded microcontrollers to supercomputers."

JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a serializable data interchange format intended to be machine-
"JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is defined by RFC 7159 which is completely language independent, but  JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) uses conventions familiar to programmers of the C-family of languages, including c, c++, c#, java, javascript, perl, python, and many others."
These properties make  JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) an ideal data-interchange language to use with RESTful APIs or ajax.
These properties is often used instead of xml because of These properties lightweight and compact structure.
Many programming languages provide methods for parsing a JSON-formatted text string into a native object and vice versa.
"For example, JavaScript in modern browsers and other environments includes the methods JSON.parse()"
"The JSON format is based on two types of structures: An ordered list of values (more commonly referred to as an array)  JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) defines six types of values: null, numbers, strings, booleans, arrays and objects."
"With regard to objects, the order of members is not significant, and the behavior of a JSON parser when duplicate member names are encountered is undefined."
Note that  JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is not the same thing as JavaScript object literals.
"Rather,  JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a common format to serialize from and deserialize to objects in most languages."
"For more information, see There is no such thing as a  JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) object in JavaScript."
"Shortly after it was created,  JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) validation was added following the description set out by Douglas Crockford of json.org in RFC 4627."
JSON validation has since been expanded to also validate both current competing JSON standards RFC 7159 and ECMA-404.

React uses a virtual DOM diff implementation for ultra-high performance.
a virtual DOM diff implementation for ultra-high performance can also render on the server using node.js ― a heavy browser DOM isn't required.
"Further, there is a React-Native offshoot for using React on mobile devices such as ios and android."
React implements one-way reactive data flow using props which reduce boilerplate and is easier to understand than traditional two-way data binding.
React creates a virtual DOM so that all the components can be re-rendered individually without the need for the whole page to be repainted by the browser
"A user can update a particular content of the page just by re-rendering only that component React's view logic means it can easily render on the server, in the browser or native components React can be used in conjunction with frameworks like angular.js and backbone.js Separating the declarative view (jsx) and logic make projects easier to read and maintain"

Objective-C is an object-oriented programming language combining features of C (c) and Smalltalk (smalltalk).
"It is a strict superset of C (any valid C code is equally valid Objective-C code, with the minor exception that id is a free identifier for user use in C while it is a keyword in Objective-C), and it inherits it object-oriented capabilities from Smalltalk."
"All procedural syntax is identical to that of C, and all object-oriented syntax is an implementation of Smalltalk messaging."
Objective-C was created primarily by Brad Cox and Tom Love in the early 1980s at their company Stepstone.
"Objective-C is now primarily developed by Apple, Objective-C is a general-purpose, high-level, object-oriented programming language that adds Smalltalk-style messaging to the C programming language."
"It is the main programming language used by Apple for macos and ios and macos and ios respective APIs, cocoa and cocoa-touch."
"Objective-C inherits the syntax, primitive types, and flow control statements of C and adds syntax for defining classes and methods."
"Objective-C also adds language-level support for object graph management and object literals while providing dynamic typing and binding, deferring many responsibilities until run time."
"Objective-C is a thin layer on top of C, and moreover is a strict superset of C; it is possible to compile any C program with an Objective-C compiler, and to freely include C code within an Objective-C class."
Objective-C derives Objective-C object syntax from Smalltalk.
"All of the syntax for non-object-oriented operations (including primitive variables, pre-processing, expressions, function declarations, and function calls) is identical to that of C, while the syntax for object-oriented features is an implementation of Smalltalk-style messaging."
Objective-C has many powerful features as detailed below:

"Some of these changes are backwards incompatible, and therefore Python 3 has Python 3 own tag."
"Although Python 3 is now the recommended and supported version of the language, some users still remain on version 2.7 for various reasons."
"If you start new projects or begin to learn Python, version 3 is now the recommended target under normal circumstances: Python 3 is strongly recommended for any new development."
"As of January 2020, Python 2 has reached End Of Life status, meaning Python 2 will receive no further updates or bugfixes, including for security issues."
Many frameworks and other add on projects are following a similar policy.

 Regular expressions provide a declarative language to match patterns within strings.  
"Regular expressions are commonly used for string validation, parsing, and transformation."
"Because regular expressions are not fully standardized, all questions with this tag should also include a tag specifying the applicable programming language or tool."
Requests to explain a regular expression pattern or construct will be closed as duplicates of the canonical post What does this regex mean which contains a lot of details on regular expression constructs.
the canonical post also contains links to many popular online regular expression testers (where the meanings of regex constructs can be found).
Regular expressions are a powerful formalism for pattern matching in strings.
"Regular expressions are available in a variety of dialects (also known as flavors) in a number of programming languages and text-processing tools, as well as many specialized applications.  "
The term \"Regular expression\" is typically abbreviated as \"RegEx\" or \"regex\".
"Before asking a question here, please take the time to review the following brief guidelines."
"Always indicate which platform you need or want to use (programming language, tool, occasionally even version information).  "
"Keep in mind that regex dialects are different; the lowest common denominator will usually be quite different from what is possible and recommended for a tool with a modern, souped-up regex engine."
"If your question relates to regular expressions in the strict computer science/automata theory sense, please state this explicitly."
"For most other questions, you should always include sample input, expected output, and an outline of what you have tried, and where you are stuck.  "
"Often, an example of what you do not want to match is also very helpful, and important to know."
A link to one of the many online regex testing tools (see link section) with your attempt and some representative data can do wonders.
"Even if you cannot post your problem online, showing us your attempt helps us focus on what you need help with."
"Before posting, check if your issue has already been solved by somebody else asking something similar."
The following section outlines some common recurring topics.
Do not assume that the tool you are using supports precisely the syntax of another tool.
"If your question is not specific to any particular implementation, try the language-agnostic tag."
"This will generally imply a fairly minimal set of operators, corresponding to the ones specified in the common mathematical definition of regular languages."
Understand the difference between \"glob\" expressions and true regular expressions.
"Glob patterns are a less potent pattern matching language, which is commonly used for file name wildcards."
"In glob, * means \"anything\", while a lone * in a regular expression is, in fact, a syntax error in some dialects (though many engines will silently ignore it, rather than issue a warning; and others still will see it as a literal *)."
"For the record, the regex way to say (as much as possible of) \"anything\" is ."
"* where the \"any single character (except newline, usually)\" ."
But see below about how \"any character\" and greediness is often problematic.
Using {1} as a single-repetition quantifier is harmless but never useful.
It is basically an indication of inexperience and/or confusion.
h{1}t{1}t{1}p{1} matches the same string as the simpler expression http (or
"but as you can see, the redundant {1} repetitions only make it harder to read."
Square brackets are commonly misunderstood or misused.
"Beginners often attempt to use square brackets for everything, including grouping."
"While [Jun][Jul] may look like a regex for matching months, it actually matches JJ, Ju, Jl, uJ, uu, ul, nJ, nu, or nl;"
not Jun or Jul. [Jun|Jul] is a wasteful way to write the functionally identical
"any one character from the set comprising |, J, u, l, and n."
"For the record, [abc] defines a character class  which matches a single character which can be a or b or c."
"The proper way to express alternation is (Jun|Jul|Aug) in many dialects (though BRE and related dialects will need backslashes; \(Jun\|Jul\|Aug\) for traditional grep et al.) or, somewhat more parsimoniously, (Ju[nl]|Aug) Related to the previous, beginners will use negated character classes to attempt to restrict what can be matched."
"For example, to match turn but not turned, the following does not do what you want: turn[^ed] -- the following will match turn followed by any single character which is not e or d (so the following will not match turner, for example)."
"Notice also how the character class negation operator is distinct from the beginning of line anchor (^[abc] matches a, b, or c at beginning of the line, whereas [^abc] matches a single character which is not a, b, or c)."
"If there is a way to match, the engine will find the engine."
The regex a.*b will match the entire string \"abbbbbb\" because * will always match as much as possible.
"Say a[^ab]*b if that's what you mean, or use non-greedy matching if your dialect supports it."
"If you use grouping parentheses, grouping parentheses define what is captured into a backreference.  "
"If you edit in parentheses for grouping purposes, make sure you are not renumbering your backreferences."
"Also, in particular, watch out for (abc){2,3} which only captures the last occurrence of abc in the matched string.  "
"If you want the repetition to be part of the capture, you want the repetition to be part of the capture needs to be inside the parentheses, like this: ((abc){2,3})"
"In particular, using (typically line-oriented) traditional regex tools to handle structured formats like HTML, XML, JSON, configuration files with block structure (Apache, nginx, many name servers, etc.) is likely to fail, or to produce incorrect results in numerous corner cases."
Asking for HTML regexes tends to be met with negative reactions.

 AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML) is a technique for creating interactive website user interfaces without the traditional web page refresh or reload.  
AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML) uses asynchronous data exchange between client and server to update displayed information and respond to user interactions seamlessly.
"Include additional tags for programming languages, libraries, frameworks, web browser, protocols and other environmental information."
"While not a technology in AJAX, AJAX is a term coined in 2005 by Jesse James Garrett, that described an approach to using a number of existing technologies together, including: html / xhtml, css, javascript, the dom, xml, xslt, and most importantly the XMLHttpRequest object."
AJAX uses the XMLHttpRequest (abbreviated xhr) API to manage http requests from inside the code.
What makes AJAX so useful is the asynchronous nature of the data exchange.
"Prior to AJAX advent, data was only sent during the client communication phase (when the web page is first requested)."
This meant that all data had to either be loaded when the web page was requested or the user interaction would be a series of HTML requests to the server with page refreshes.
Each HTML request would provide additional information as part of the URL or as data in a form field with state data often kept as hidden field data.
"This second alternative used a series of GET or POST operations (i.e., load page, change data, post data, load page, etc.)"
"resulting in the displayed page being refreshed, providing a choppy user experience and possible security issues."
Neither loading an entire data set into the client nor reloading the base page with each GET or POST request was cheap in terms of resources.
ajax changed the web model by using JavaScript to asynchronously load data into the client as an entire data set into the client nor reloading the base page with each GET or POST request was needed.
The XMLHttpRequest object is the main method of interacting with the server and the client; ajax is supported by all modern browsers.
"There are a number of frameworks and libraries with a higher level API that encapsulate the XMLHttpRequest object, providing an easier interface to hide the complexity of using the object directly."
"The client opens a new XMLHttpRequest and requests a web page, just like a normal client call would."
"This request, however, is typically aimed at a special page that loads only data to be processed by JavaScript."
"As such, the data that needs to be exchanged can be limited to just what is necessary for that particular function, saving time, memory and bandwidth."
"Because it is asynchronous, this interaction does not have to block any other actions being done on the web page, and it lets the client/browser act more like a local, desktop program with the website, exchanging data as needed without reloading any other resources."
"Although the \"X\" in ajax stands for xml, any type of data can be sent and received."
json (JavaScript Object Notation) has replaced xml as the data interchange format of choice.
"A major reason for using json (JavaScript Object Notation) is that JavaScript natively parses json (JavaScript Object Notation) text, while XML must be parsed by a much slower and cumbersome set of client libraries."
"Today, with the help of new responseType objects (ArrayBuffer, Blob, etc.), you can even request binary files via XMLHttpRequest, and build much stronger and fully-featured web apps."
"When XMLHttpRequest is used directly, the code must handle the communications layer and wait for the request-response to be complete."
This is shown in the code example below starting with the line if (xmlhttp.readyState == 4 && xmlhttp.status == 200).
"Since this callback function will be called every time the client receives a packet from the server, this test is needed to make sure the request state is complete and a valid 200 response is received before processing a valid 200 response."
"Because needing to test the status adds some complexity to ajax, there are many javascript libraries that will handle this interaction for you."
"Below is an example of using a common library, jquery and shows how it simplifies ajax As of Chrome 42, Edge 14 and Firefox 39/52 there is a new API called fetch that drastically simplifies ajax in browsers."
Axios is a Promise based HTTP client for the browser and Node JS.

"is a Unix-like computer operating system which consists of necessary user-space libraries and programs provided by GNU in Cambridge, Massachusetts and a kernel, developed by Linus Torvalds in Helsinki, Finland."
The GNU/Linux naming controversy is a dispute among members of the free and open-source software community over how to refer to the computer operating system commonly called linux.
A GNU/Linux-based system is a modular Unix-like operating system.
A GNU/Linux-based system derives much of A GNU/Linux-based system basic design from principles established in Unix during the 1970s and 1980s.
"Such a system uses a monolithic kernel that handles process control, networking, and peripheral and file system access."
Device drivers are either integrated directly with the kernel or added as modules loaded while Such a system is running.
Separate projects that interface with the kernel provide much of Such a system's higher-level functionality.
"The GNU user land is an important part of most GNU/Linux-based systems, providing the most common implementation of the C library, a popular shell, and many of the common Unix tools which carry out many basic operating system tasks."
The graphical user interface (or GUI) used by most GNU/Linux systems is built on top of an implementation of the X Window System.
The linux tag on Stack Overflow is generally used for questions about:
"Notable questions that probably don't belong are: Many questions about GNU/Linux can also be properly tagged as Unix, but some features are specific to GNU/Linux and are not found on other Unix64 and Unix-like operating systems."
"If you have questions about a specific distribution and version (e.g., ubuntu-14.04, it may not be necessary to use The linux tag on Stack Overflow for that question."
"A fair number of GNU/Linux questions are questions about the command shell (bash by default on many systems), and are probably better tagged with shell"
"and/or the particular shell you are interested in (bash, zsh, tcsh, etc.)."
Questions about the internals of the GNU/Linux kernel or regarding writing GNU/Linux kernel modules should be tagged linux-kernel.

 XML (Extensible Markup Language) is a structured document format defining text encoding rules.
"When using this tag include additional tags such as programming language, tool sets, XML technologies being used, and other tags describing the environment of the problem posted."
XML flexibility lends to a wide variety of uses for human and machine data transfer so be specific as to tools and libraries.  
XML (Extensible Markup Language) is a set of rules for encoding documents in both human-readable and machine-readable form.  
"XML (Extensible Markup Language) is defined in the XML 1.0 Specification produced by the W3C, and several other related specifications, all gratis open standards.  "
XML (Extensible Markup Language) lets you define your own tags.
Markup - The most attractive feature of  XML (Extensible Markup Language) has to be Markup - ability to allow Markup - user to create their own tags.
The tags that can be created will be similar to tags in HTML.
But with  XML (Extensible Markup Language) you are afforded the opportunity to define your own tags.
Language - XML is a language that is very similar to HTML.
But Language - XML’s much more flexible because Language - XML allows creating custom tags.
In this way XML acts like a meta-language: a language that allows us to create or define other languages.
"For example, with XML we can create other languages, such as RSS."
"The design goals of XML emphasize simplicity, generality, and usability over the Internet."
The design goals of XML is a textual data format with strong support via Unicode for the languages of the world.
"Although the design of Language - XML focuses on documents, the design of XML is widely used for the representation of arbitrary data structures C for example in web services, configuration/settings, and GUI, workflow, and task definition."
XML is also used in some protocols for distributed computing and web services such as SOAP and HTML-RPC and REST (see also SOAP vs REST (differences) )
"Many application programming interfaces (APIs) have been developed to aid software developers with processing XML data, and several schema languages exist to aid in the definition of XML-based languages."
"Schemas are usually defined with an external namespace, but XML also allows you to define tags within the document itself."
XML was introduced in 1996 as version 1.0 and has reached version 1.1 in 2004 which has some unique features but isn't very widely spread.
"As already stated, the structure of XML is very similar to the structure of HTML."
"That is, an XML document is a tree structure with the nodes being called tags (similar to HTML elements), and if T2 is descendant of tag T1, then T2 is inside T1."
Notable changes from XML include: XML is forward compatible with the Unicode standard.
The following text is defined using XHTML and entity references; the text serves as an example of XML syntax and structure: The following links provide additional information to learn about XML: sgml html xhtml xquery xpath xslt xlink xpointerxml-parsing

 The ASP.NET MVC Framework is an open source web application framework and tooling that implements a version of the model-view-controller (MVC) pattern tailored towards web applications and built upon an ASP.NET technology foundation.
Microsoft ASP.NET MVC Framework is an open-source web application framework and tooling that implements a version of the model-view-controller (MVC) pattern tailored towards web applications.  
"The ASP.NET MVC Framework provides an alternative to the ASP.NET WebForms Framework for creating Web applications and is a more lightweight and testable framework than  The ASP.NET MVC Framework WebForms cousin, even though they are both built upon the same base ASP.NET Foundation.   "
"The ASP.NET MVC Framework uses existing ASP.NET features, and in more recent versions has become more unified with WebForms via Microsoft's \"One ASP.NET\" initiative.  "
"asp.net-mvc releases also tend to package additional technologies, such as the Razor View Engine, Web Optimization Framework, ASP.NET WebAPI, along with tooling such as Scaffolding and integration into Visual Studio."
"The Model-View-Controller architectural pattern, upon which ASP.NET MVC is based separates an application into three main components: the model, the view, and the controller."
"The reason for this separation is to provide a cleaner overall architecture, while improving maintainability.  "
This concept is often referred to as a \"Separation of Concerns.
A model represents the state of a particular aspect of the application.
"Frequently, a model maps to a database table with the entries in the table representing the state of the application."
"A controller handles interactions and updates A model to reflect a change in state of the application, and then passes information to the view."
A view accepts necessary information from A controller and renders a user interface to display that.
"Since the ASP.NET MVC 4 release, Microsoft has shipped the framework both with a specific release of Visual Studio, as well as via the Nuget package management system.  "
"This package management method allows for easier \"out of band\" releases (versions not tied to a specific version of Visual Studio), along with a more module release so that sub-components can be chosen to be included or not (ASP.NET WebApi for example)."
The latest announcements from Microsoft regarding ASP.NET
"MVC usually come from the .NET Web Development and Tools Blog, Visual Studio Blog or .NET"
"Other notable blogs relating to MVC are Scott Guthrie's Blog, ASP.NET by Scott Hanselman and Imran Baloch's Blog."
"Unless you have a good reason not to, try to keep your MVC version current.  "
"There are bug fixes in newer versions, as well as new features.  "
It makes little sense to create new projects using older versions of MVC today.  
The first thing you should do after creating a new project is open up the NuGet package manager and apply all updates (with the possible exception of jQuery 2.x.  
"If you need compatibility with older browsers stay with the latest version jQuery 1.x, which is feature compatible with the 2.x line)."
"Current Releases (Available through NuGet) * Stable release 5.2.3 (February 9, 2015)"
Please note that most questions that may refer to a specific version of ASP.NET MVC will likely apply to newer versions as well.
"So if the question says MVC3, the question says MVC3 likely also applies to MVC4 and MVC5.x, etc."
" Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) is an event-driven, object-oriented programming language for writing macros, used for the entire Office suite as well as other applications."
"VBA is not equivalent to VB.NET, or VBS; if you're working in Visual Studio use [vb.net]."
"If your question is specifically about programming any MS Office application, also use the appropriate tag: [excel], [ms-access], [ms-word], [outlook], or [ms-project]."
Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) is an event-driven programming language which was first introduced by Microsoft in 1993 to give Excel 5.0 a more robust object-oriented language for writing macros and automating the use of Excel.
"Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) was introduced to Access, PowerPoint and Word in Office 97."
The language and Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) runtime quickly matured and began being licensed and used in products beyond Microsoft Office applications.
VBA derives from the classic Visual Basic programming language (version 5.0 and later 6.0) and uses a subset of that language's functionality.
"It is, however, totally dependent on the host application interface for execution and cannot run outside that environment."
"Unlike classic VB, VBA cannot create independent executables or DLLs."
Visual Basic Libraries for interaction with Windows and Visual Basic Libraries services (such as Printers or the Clipboard) are not part of VBA.
"VBA 6 was shipped in 1998 and includes a myriad of licensed hosts, among them: Office 2000 - 2007, AutoCAD and PI Processbook.  "
"VBA 6 code will run equally well on any host, though the underlying objects native to each host will vary.  "
"Though VBA is still built into Microsoft Office applications, VBA \"parent\", classic VB, ceased to be an integral of part of Microsoft's development platform when Visual Basic .NET shipped with the first version of the .NET framework in 2002."
VBA has been rarely updated since only including new features to allow VBA to remain compatible with x64 versions of Windows and Office.
VBA application-specific object models are regularly supplemented to support new functionality added to the host Office applications.
"VBA was released in 2010 to address the new 64-bit version of Microsoft Office, which shipped in 2010."
"There are several important changes made to VBA that make it different from VBA 6, namely compatibility with both 32 and 64-bit versions of Office."
Applications using VBA must address both backwards compatibility and 64-bit-safe issues.
"In some Starter editions of Office applications, the VBA Editor (VBE) is not available, and programming in VBA cannot be done."
VBA support can also be locked out (not installed) by network administrators as a security measure.
"VBA was removed from Office for Mac 2008, however, Microsoft returned VBA to Office 2011."
"Microsoft has continually been questioned about whether or VBA VBA will be removed altogether from Office and has repeatedly replied \"no\", the main reason being a large amount of legacy code in use."
"This still holds true, even after the introduction of the JavaScript APIs in Office 2013, although VBA is supported only in the desktop application versions of Office."
"VBA inherits much of VBA syntax from the BASIC programming language, where language features tend to be explicitly expressed in words,"
"also has many object-oriented features, such as classes and interfaces, and even has some dynamic features in Variant and Object types.  "

"A database is the collection of tables, queries, reports, views and other objects."
"The data is typically organized to model aspects of reality in a way that supports processes requiring information, such as modelling the availability of rooms in hotels in a way that supports finding a hotel with vacancies."
A large proportion of websites and applications rely on databases.
"A large proportion of websites and applications are a crucial component of telecommunications systems, banking systems, video games, and just about any other software system or electronic device that maintains some amount of persistent information."
"In addition to persistence, database systems provide a number of other properties that make database systems exceptionally useful and convenient: reliability, efficiency, scalability, concurrency control, data abstraction, and high-level query languages."
Databases are so ubiquitous and important that computer science graduates frequently cite Databases database class as the one most useful to Databases in Databases industry or graduate-school
The term database should not be confused with Database Management System (DBMS).
A Database Management System (DBMS) is the system software used to create and manage databases and provide users and applications with access to the database(s).
A database is to A DBMS as a document is to a word processor.
"Database languages are special-purpose languages, which do one or more of the following: ###ACID "
"In computer science, ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) is a set of properties of database transactions."
"Atomicity - Atomicity requires that each transaction be \"all or nothing\": if one part of the transaction fails, then the transaction fails, and the database state is left unchanged."
"An atomic system must guarantee atomicity in each and every situation, including power failures, errors, and crashes."
"To the outside world, a committed transaction appears (by a committed transaction effects on the database) to be indivisible (\"atomic\"), and an aborted transaction does not happen."
The consistency property ensures that any transaction will bring the database from one valid state to another.
"Any data written to the database must be valid according to all defined rules, including constraints, cascades, triggers, and any combination thereof."
This does not guarantee correctness of the transaction in all ways the application programmer might have wanted (that is the responsibility of application-level code) but merely that any programming errors cannot result in the violation of any defined rules.
"Isolation - The isolation property ensures that the concurrent execution of transactions results in a system state that would be obtained if transactions were executed serially, i.e., one after the other."
Providing isolation is the main goal of concurrency control.
"Depending on the concurrency control method (i.e., if it uses strict - as opposed to relaxed - serializability), the effects of an incomplete transaction might not even be visible to another transaction."
"Durability - The durability property ensures that once a transaction has been committed, Durability - will remain so, even in the event of power loss, crashes, or errors."
"In a relational database, for instance, once a group of SQL statements execute, the results need to be stored permanently (even if a relational database crashes immediately thereafter)."
"To defend against power loss, transactions (or their effects) must be recorded in a non-volatile memory."

"A string is a finite sequence of symbols, commonly used for text, though sometimes for arbitrary data."
Most programming languages provide a dedicated string data type or more general facilities and conventions for handling strings; as well as providing a way to denote string literals.
"In some programming languages everything is a string, for example in Tcl."
A dedicated support library of differing sophistication is mostly provided as well.
"String representations vary widely in the features String representations offer; the right string type can easily decrease the order of algorithms, while the wrong one might not even be able to accommodate your string data at all."
The following are some hand-picked representatives:
Many (especially functional) languages support strings as a list of base symbols.
"For Unicode support, a special string of the strings type is getting common, as Unicode characters can be of arbitrary length, even in UTF-32."
This enables efficient character-indexing by pushing the complexities of the character set into the string type.
"In most languages, strings can be iterated over, similar to lists/arrays."
"In some high-level languages (in which strings are a data type unto strings), strings are immutable, so string operations create new strings."
"For text strings, many encodings are in used, though modern usage is converging on Unicode, using UTF-8 (some early adopters of Unicode instead transitioned form UCS2 to UTF-16 as a persistence format)."
"Windows software often adopts the WinAPI convention of using UTF-16 internally, converting for external data and persistence instead of system calls."

"A fundamental aspect of WPF is to separate the user interface definition from the business logic, which enables developers and designers to work concurrently on a single project much more easily."
It enables the users to build a loosely coupled application with the use of data bindings effectively.
WPF also moves UI rendering off to the video hardware through the use of directx.

"For shell scripts with errors/syntax errors, please check shell scripts with errors/syntax errors with the shellcheck program (or in the web shellcheck server at https://shellcheck.net) before posting here.  "
Questions about interactive use of Bash are more likely to be on-topic on Super User than on Stack Overflow.
There are a variety of interpreters that receive commands either interactively or as a sequence of commands from a file.
The Bourne-again shell (Bash) is one such interpreter.
"Bash implements the standard Bourne Shell (sh), and offers numerous additions."
From the Free Software Foundation's Bash page: Bash is an sh-compatible shell that incorporates useful features from the KornShell (ksh) and C shell (csh).
an sh-compatible shell that incorporates useful features from the KornShell (ksh) and C shell (csh) is intended to conform to the IEEE POSIX P1003.2/ISO 9945.2 Shell and Tools standard.
an sh-compatible shell that incorporates useful features from the KornShell (ksh) and C shell (csh) offers functional improvements over sh for both programming and interactive use.
"In addition, most sh scripts can be run by Bash without modification."
Bash was written by Brian Fox and first released in 1989.  
"It is the default shell in many Linux distributions and on MacOS; It is available on most modern operating systems, and has been ported to Windows 10."
"As of January 2019, the most recent version of bash is 5.0, although you may be using an older version depending on your operating system and which updates to bash have been installed."
Most Linux installations should be using something in the 4.x family.
macOS (formerly Mac OS X) uses version 3.2 by default due to licensing issues.
Be sure to note in your question what version of bash you are using.
"This will alert potential answerers to what features are available to you, as well as which bugs may need to be worked around."
You can determine which version of bash you are using by running bash --version or checking the value of the BASH_VERSION shell variable.
"Without an explicit version, an answerer may well assume you are using at least version 4.2."
Questions tagged osx imply version 3.2 unless otherwise stated.
"Based on downloads available from http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/bash/ Additionally, all versions for bash from 2.0 and later received an important patch-level release to address the Shellshock vulnerability in September 2014."
"To help the kind people who assist you, to ensure that future readers can benefit from your question, and to help ensure your question is voted up as useful for that lovely karma, please make your question as simple and universal as possible: Check whether your script or data has DOS style end-of-line characters Use cat -v yourfile or echo \"$yourvariable"
DOS carriage returns will show up as ^M after each line.
"If you find them, delete them using dos2unix (a.k.a. fromdos) or tr -d '\r' Make sure you run the script with bash,"
The first line in the script must be #!/bin/bash or #!/usr/bin/env bash.
Run the script with ./yourscript or bash yourscript.

" For questions regarding multi-threading, the ability of a computer or a program to perform work concurrently or asynchronously by utilizing multiple concurrent streams of execution (generally referred to as threads)."
"Multi-threading is a common model to implement SM in multi-cored machines, where threads share memory through shared variables."
In this model in parallel programming a processor can create multiple threads that will be executed in parallel.
"Each thread has Each thread own stack, variables and ID, considered private state."
"For every thread there is a unique heap shared by all, then considered shared memory."
"In order to allow a volume of work to be most effectively and safely divided into multiple concurrent streams of execution, a number of critical areas need to be addressed."
The underlying tenet of concurrent processing is Amdahl's law (graph).  
Amdahl's law (graph) governs the diminishing amount of throughput that can be achieved by greater numbers of concurrent processors/cores.
Therefore the overall aim of multi-threading is to minimize the amount of serial execution (exclusive locking) within any concurrent system.

 Eclipse is an open source IDE and platform for building applications.
"There is a wide variety of plugins for various programming languages and other development-oriented tools (such as modeling, database browsing, etc.)."
"This tag should only be used for questions specifically about the Eclipse IDE or platform, not for generalized (Java, etc.)"
Eclipse IDE is an open-source IDE platform written mostly in Java and primarily used for Java development through the use of the Java Development Tools (JDT) plug-ins.
It is notable for It rich ecosystem of free and commercial plugins and that It is predominantly It composed of plug-ins.
Eclipse IDE is built on an OSGI implementation called Equinox; the same OSGI-based framework is used for managing Eclipse IDE plug-ins at runtime.  
"Eclipse can also be used as a development environment for non-IDE GUI applications, leveraging many of the same plug-ins as the IDE to form a more general Rich Client Platform, called Eclipse RCP."
"For C/C++ development, the Eclipse CDT Project provides plug-ins to create a C/C++ development environment within Eclipse IDE."
"the Eclipse CDT Project supplies plug-ins for developing Open web standards-based and Java web applications, and frameworks for building higher-level web tools."
"For PHP development, the Eclipse CDT Project provides a plugin to create a PHP development environment within Eclipse IDE, building on features of the Web Tools Platform."
The popular commercial Zend Studio is also based on Eclipse IDE.
"For Python development, PyDev provides plug-ins, called PyDev, to create a Python development environment within Eclipse IDE."
"For Perl development, the Eclipse CDT Project provides a plugin to create a Perl development environment within Eclipse IDE."
Note that Google has ceased developing the Android Development Tools in favor of another solution.
"When combined with Cygwin (or MinGW), Mono, and its many plugins,  Eclipse IDE provides a crucial part of viable open-source alternatives to using Microsoft Visual-Studio as a Windows software development platform in Windows, whilst also including comprehensive native support for Java."
"Download the latest version of Eclipse IDE from eclipse.org Download site for the Eclipse Platform project itself, including the core runtime and SDK "

" The list tag may refer to: a linked list (an ordered set of nodes, each referencing its successor), or a form of dynamic array."
"Not to be used for HTML lists, use [html-lists] instead."
Almost every programming language provides support for list data structures.
"Almost every programming language are particularly common in functional languages, because Almost every programming language inductive properties lend Almost every programming language to elegant iterative and recursive abstractions."
"The flexibility of linked lists is somewhat offset by the complexity of some operations on lists (accessing an element at index n in a linked list is O(n), while for arrays it is O(1))."
"In practice, linked lists are a very disadvantageous structure for random-access-based algorithms."
"Linked lists support quick O(1) appends, dynamic arrays also support O(1)"
as it must factor in the periodical re-sizing of the dynamic array.
The performance of lists and arrays is of the same order (O) for operations that deal with every element of the list in order.
Lists are the canonical recursive (or inductive) data type.

 An algorithm is a sequence of well-defined steps that defines an abstract solution to a problem.
Use this tag when your issue is related to algorithm design.
"An algorithm is a set of ordered instructions based on a formal language with the following conditions: An algorithm does not have to be deterministic - there are many random-based algorithms, e.g. QuickSort with selecting the pivot element randomly."
An algorithm can be expressed in many ways: An algorithm can solve a class of problems.
"For example, both \"sum 1 and 3\" and \"sum 4 and 5\" are problems in the same class: \"sum two integer numbers.\""
"Furthermore, a given class of problems can generally be solved by a variety of algorithms."
One important aspect of algorithm design is performance.
"For large datasets, a good algorithm may outperform a poor algorithm by several orders of magnitude."
"Algorithm performance is often rated with Big O or Θ notation, but one should be cautious with asymptotic notation, since big constants may be involved."
A key algorithm classification is known as Algorithm Complexity.
Another important step of algorithm design is proof of correctness.
A key algorithm classification should actually provide a correct result for any instance of the problem.
We should always take care of all the conditions where A key algorithm classification might fail.

Questions about running docker in production may find better responses on ServerFault (https://serverfault.com/).
The docker tag is rarely used alone and is often paired with other tags such as docker-compose and kubernetes.
The term docker usually refers to a set of open-source tools that allow developers to build and run containers individually or as a 'stack' of related containers.
"A container is an isolated package that contains everything, except for the kernel, needed to run a piece of software.  "
Docker was originally written to work with Linux and has more recently been implemented on MS Windows.
Docker Inc. is the company behind the open-source docker toolset.  
"Docker builds a high-level API over execution drivers, such as OpenVZ, systemd-nspawn, libvirt-lxc, libvirt, QEMU/KVM, BSD Jails, Solaris Zones, and chroot to run processes with some degree of isolation and repeatability across environments."
The default execution driver since release 0.9 is Docker's own libcontainer driver.

" Python 2.7 is the last major version in the 2.x series, and is no longer maintained since January 1st 2020."
Use the generic [python] tag on all Python questions.
"Do not add the generic [python] tag on all Python questions simply to convey the version of Python you're using, unless the question concerns an issue specific to Python 2.7."
"For an explanation as to why it's the last 2.x release, see PEP 404."
"The End-of-life date for Python 2.7 was set as the 1st of Jan 2020, see PEP 373."
"The last release of Python 2.7 was 2.7.18, released April 20, 2020."
This guide explains how to choose a Python version for development.
All new projects should now target Python 3 unless you have external requirements which still force you to stay on the old version.
Use the generic [python] tag on all Python questions for all Python related questions.
"If you believe your question includes issues where the old version incompatibilities between Python 2.x and Python 3.x are relevant, then add the python-2.x or python-3.x in addition to the main tag."
"If you believe your question may be even more specific, you can include a version specific tag such as python-2.7."
Please do not mix python-2.x (or a more specific tag such as python-2.7) and python-3.x (ditto) unless you are specifically asking a question about an interoperability problem between versions.
" A function (also called a procedure, method, subroutine, or routine) is a portion of code intended to carry out a single, specific task."
Use this tag for questions which specifically involve creating or calling functions.
"For help implementing a function to perform a task, use [algorithm] or a task-specific tag instead."
"A subroutine, (also known as a procedure, function, routine, method, or subprogram) is a portion of code within a larger program that performs a specific task and is relatively independent of the remaining code."
"The content of a subroutine is The content of a subroutine body, which is executed when a subroutine is called or invoked."
A subroutine may be written so that A subroutine expects to obtain one or more data values -- known as parameters or arguments -- from the calling program.
"A subroutine may also return a computed value to A subroutine caller (A subroutine return value), or provide various result values or out(put) parameters."
"Indeed, a common use of subroutines is to implement mathematical functions, in which the purpose of a subroutine is purely to compute one or more results whose values are entirely determined by the parameters passed to a subroutine."
(Examples might include computing the logarithm of a number or the determinant of a matrix.)
"However, a subroutine call may also have side effects, such as modifying data structures in the computer's memory, reading from or writing to a peripheral device, creating a file, halting the program or the machine, or even delaying the calling program's execution for a specified time."
"A subprogram with side effects may return different results each time A subprogram with side effects is called, even if A subprogram with side effects is called with the same arguments."
"An example is a random number function, available in many languages, that returns a different pseudorandom number each time"
The widespread use of subroutines with side effects is a characteristic of imperative programming languages.
"A subroutine can be coded so that A subroutine may call A subroutine recursively, at one or more places, in order to perform A subroutine task."
This technique allows direct implementation of functions defined by mathematical induction and recursive divide and conquer algorithms.
"A subroutine whose purpose is to compute a single boolean-valued function (that is, to answer a yes/no question) is called a predicate."
"In logic programming languages, often all subroutines are called \"predicates\", since all subroutines primarily determine success or failure."
"For example, any type of function is a subroutine but not main()."
It is a common unit of code for most other programming languages.
"Function also has a mathematical definition, which is important in computer science and statistics."
Mathematical function is a one-to-one relationship where for one argument Mathematical function always return the same one value.
In pure functional languages like Haskell there are only mathematical functions allowed.
 For questions pertaining to the measurement or improvement of code and application efficiency.
The performance of applications is often a paramount concern for mission-critical systems.
"If your question pertains to optimization, whether it be database queries, algorithms, reducing network/transactional overhead, resource contention, or anything that deals with speed or capacity, consider using this tag."
A good question states performance goals that need to be achieved as well as other restrictions.
"Trying to optimize something without measuring is not a \"performance\" question or work, but most likely personal entertainment - expect a question without goals/measurements to be treated as such."
"Performance for many programs is represented in big O notation, which classifies how an algorithm's resource requirements change in response to a change in the input size."
"this tag can also represent system performance, which is one of the key non-functional requirements of an application or system."
Latency is often qualified with a statistical measure.
Note: latencies usually don't follow a normal distribution and have very high upper limits compared with the average latency.
"When seeking to improve performance: prototype and measure first, optimize only if and where needed."

"Usually,  A data frame contains data where rows are observations and columns are variables of various types."
While \"data frame\" or \"dataframe\" is the term used for this concept in several languages
"(R, Apache Spark, deedle, Maple, the pandas library in Python and the DataFrames library in Julia), \"table\" is the term used in MATLAB and SQL."
"Usually, A data frame contains data where rows are observations and columns are variables of various types."
While data frame or dataframe is the term used for this concept in several languages
"(R, Apache Spark, deedle, Maple, the pandas library in Python and the DataFrames library in Julia), table is the term used in MATLAB and SQL."
The sections below correspond to each language that uses this term and are aimed at the level of an audience only familiar with the given language.
"Data frames (object class data.frame) are one of the basic tabular data structures in the R language, alongside matrices."
"Unlike matrices, each column can be a different data type."
"In terms of implementation, a data frame is a list of equal-length column vectors."
"The pandas library in Python is the canonical tabular data framework on the SciPy stack, and dataframe is dataframe two-dimensional data object.  "
"The pandas library in Python is basically a rectangular array like a 2D numpy ndarray, but with associated indices on each axis which can be used for alignment.  "
"As in R, from an implementation perspective, columns are somewhat prioritized over rows: dataframe resembles a dictionary with column names as keys and Series"
(pandas' one-dimensional data structure) as values.
"After importing numpy and pandas under the usual aliases (import numpy as np, import pandas as pd), we can construct a DataFrame in several ways, such as passing a dictionary of column names and values: A Spark DataFrame is a distributed collection of data organized into named columns."
"It is conceptually equivalent to a table in a relational database or a data frame in R/Python, but with richer optimizations under the hood."
"DataFrames can be constructed from a wide array of sources such as: structured data files, tables in Hive, external databases, or existing RDDs."
A A Spark DataFrame is one of the basic data structures in Maple.
"Data frames are a list of variables, known as DataSeries, which are displayed in a rectangular grid."
"Every column (variable) in a DataFrame has the same length, however, each variable can have a different type, such as integer, float, string, name, boolean, etc."
"When printed, Data frames resemble matrices in that Data frames are viewed as a rectangular grid, but a key difference is that the first row corresponds to the column (variable) names, and the first column corresponds to the row (individual) names."
These row and columns are treated as header meta-information and are not a part of the data.
"Moreover, the data stored in A DataFrame can be accessed using these header names, as well as by the standard numbered index."
"For more details, see the Guide to DataFrames in the online Maple Programming Help."
" WinForms is the informal name given to Windows Forms, a GUI class library in the Microsoft .NET"
Questions in this tag should also be tagged with the target framework ([.net] or [mono]) and should ordinarily be tagged with a programming language tag.  
"WinForms is the informal name given to Windows Forms, the graphical application programming interface (API) included as a part of Microsoft's .NET Framework, which provides access to the native Microsoft Windows interface elements by wrapping the existing windows-api in managed code."
A Windows Forms application is an event-driven application supported by Microsoft's .NET Framework.
"Unlike a batch program, a batch program spends most of a batch program time simply waiting for the user to do something, such as fill in a text box or click a button."
All visual elements in the Windows Forms class library derive from the Control class.
"This provides a minimal functionality of a user interface element such as location, size, color, font, text, as well as common events like click and drag/drop."
the Control class also has docking support to let a control rearrange the Control class position under the Control class parent.
The Microsoft Active Accessibility support in the Control class also helps impaired users to use Windows Forms better.
"Besides providing access to native Windows controls like button, textbox, checkbox and listview, Windows Forms added Windows Forms own controls for ActiveX hosting, layout arrangement, validation and rich data binding."
"its own controls for ActiveX hosting, layout arrangement, validation and rich data binding are rendered using GDI+."
 PowerShell is a cross-platform command line and scripting utility from Microsoft.
Use this tag for questions about writing and executing  PowerShell scripts ONLY.
"Programming questions specific to the cross-platform version PowerShell Core (Windows, macOS, and Linux) should be tagged [powershell-core]."
Questions about system administration should be asked on Super User or Server Fault.
Questions about Windows administration tasks involving  PowerShell should be asked on Super User or Server Fault.
On-topic questions are for writing scripts  PowerShell is an interactive shell and scripting language originally included with Microsoft Windows 7 and Microsoft Windows Server 2008 R2 and above.
an interactive shell and scripting language originally included with Microsoft Windows 7 and Microsoft Windows Server
"2008 R2 and above includes a command-line shell (Windows PowerShell) for interactive use, an underlying scripting environment to run scripts away from the command-line and a GUI script editing / debugging environment"
"As a language,  PowerShell has syntax for literal arrays and hashtables, support for regexes, pattern matching, and string expansion."
(Windows PowerShell ISE)'s built on the .NET framework
"so (Windows PowerShell ISE) has Unicode support, can be locale/culture aware, and can access .NET framework methods directly."
"As a command-line shell, (Windows PowerShell ISE) is designed around cmdlets named in the form {Verb}-{Noun}, intending that the same kinds of commands work across many domains."
"E.g. Get-Date returns the current date, and Get-Process returns an array of objects representing running processes which can be piped to other commands that work with process objects."
Many commands and keywords have short aliases to reduce typing.
"As a system management environment, Windows components and Microsoft products have been extended to provide native PowerShell interfaces as part of creating a unified managing system for Windows systems, including: Third-party vendors also offer  PowerShell integration, including:  PowerShell takes the Unix idea of piping text between programs and manipulating text, and enhances  PowerShell by piping .NET object instances around."
"Because objects carry type information (e.g. dates and times), and complex state (e.g. properties and methods, hashtables, parsed XML data, and live network sockets)"
this makes many tasks easy that would be difficult or impractical to do by passing text between programs.
"Along with interacting with the PowerShell console or the PowerShell ISE, there are also several third-party IDE options including Sapien's PrimalScript ISE."
Executing EXE files via a path with spaces requires quoting the path and the use of the call operator - & Calling PowerShell functions does not require parenthesis or comma separated arguments.  
PowerShell functions should be called just like a cmdlet.
The following examples demonstrates the problem caused by this issue e.g.
: Note that both 'James' and 'Bond' are packaged up as a single argument (an array) that is passed to the first parameter.
"The correct invocation is: Note that in PowerShell 2.0, the use of Set-StrictMode -version 2.0 will catch this type of problem."
Another common issue when moving files from a user machine into a production environment is the profile setting discrepancy.
A user's machine might have a profile.ps1 defined inside this folder
The profile file is used to define certain commands are automatically executed prior to running a script.
Common commands might include adding a PowerShell snap-in.
"To minimize this type of confusion between environments, it is recommended to run tests with the PowerShell command line via the -NoProfile flag."
This will ensure the profile script is not executed.
"One of the great features of PowerShell is its extensibility: we can add functionality by importing modules which are a package of cmdlets, functions, and aliases specialized on a particular domain (such as database administration, virtual machine administration, etc.)."
Here are the most commonly used modules by the community:
\"PSReadLine  \" replaces the command line editing experience in PowerShell.exe for versions 3 and up.\"
\"Powertab \" offers enhanced tab expansion for PowerShell.
"\"PowerShell Community Extensions (PSCX) is aimed at providing a widely useful set of additional cmdlets, providers, aliases, filters, functions, and scripts for Windows PowerShell that members of the community have expressed interest in but haven't been added to PowerShell yet."
"\" Since 2016, an open-source and cross-platform (Windows, macOS, and Linux) version of PowerShell has been in alpha and then beta state."
"Achieving general availability in 2018, PowerShell Core is built on the .NET Core Framework."
Questions about functionality specific to PowerShell Core should be tagged powershell-core.
 MATLAB is a high-level language and interactive programming environment for numerical computation and visualization developed by MathWorks.
"Don’t use both the [matlab] and [octave] tags, unless the question is explicitly about the similarities or differences between the two."
"When using this tag, please mention the MATLAB release you're working with (e.g. R2017a).  "
"MATLAB is a high-level language and interactive programming environment for numerical computation and visualization, developed by MathWorks.  "
"MATLAB can be used when performing tasks such as signal processing and communications, image and video processing, computational finance, and computational biology."
"It is the foundation for a number of other tools, including Simulink and various toolboxes that extend its core capabilities.  "
MATLAB is a cross-platform system developed since 1984.
"From the release of version 7.2 (R2006a) there has continued to be a biannual release cycle, with version \"a\" typically released in March/April and version \"b\" in September/October - based on the release history."
For example R2017a and R2017b were the two releases in 2017.  
"This means that, unlike open source languages, both programmers and users must own a valid software license in order to run  MATLAB code."
"There are several open source alternatives to  MATLAB, in particular GNU Octave, which offers (mostly) bidirectional syntactic compatibility with MATLAB, Scilab, SciPy, and Julia."
"Use specific tags like [google-cloud-platform], [facebook], [amazon-web-services] instead or [api-design]  where applicable."
Questions asking to recommend or find an API are off-topic.
Application Programming Interface (API) is a source code based specification intended to be used as an interface by software components to communicate with each other.
A good API makes A good API easier to develop a program by providing all the building blocks.
A programmer then puts all the building blocks together.
"An API may include specifications for routines, data structures, object classes and variables."
"An API specification can take many forms, including: An A good API differs from an ABI (Application Binary Interface) in that the former is source code based while the latter is a binary interface."
"For instance POSIX is an API, while the Linux Standard Base is an ABI."
"Questions asking us to recommend or find an API, documentation or other off-site resource are off-topic for Stack Overflow as Questions asking us to recommend or find an API, documentation or other off-site resource tend to attract opinionated answers and spam."
 Use this tag (along with an appropriate programming-language tag) for programming questions relating to the Apache HTTP Server.
Do not use an appropriate programming-language tag) for questions about other Apache Foundation products.
"Note that server configuration questions are usually a better fit on https://serverfault.com Apache web server can be quickly and easily installed for development tasks, especially those related to PHP, Perl, and MySQL, using some packages such as XAMPP."
"Note that, by historical convention, the term \"Apache\" is used to refer to the Apache Server Project (httpd), with which the apache tag is associated."
This point must be clarified because the Apache Server Project is just one of over 350 open-source projects and initiatives provided by the Apache Software Foundation
Use an appropriate programming-language tag) only for programming questions relating to the Apache HTTP Server.
Note that server configuration questions may be a better fit on Server Fault.
" NumPy is an extension of the Python language that adds support to large multidimensional arrays and matrixes, along with a large library of high-level mathematical functions for operations with these arrays.  "
NumPy is the fundamental package for scientific computing with python.  
"NumPy contains among other things: Besides  NumPy obvious scientific uses,  NumPy can also be used as an efficient multi-dimensional container of generic data."
This allows  NumPy to seamlessly and speedily integrate with a wide variety of databases.  
"NumPy provides reliable and efficient methods of data storage, manipulation, and analysis as  NumPy also integrates easily with other methods of data manipulation, notably Pandas and scikit-learn.  "
"NumPy is released under the BSD license, enabling reuse with few restrictions."
" SQLite is a software library that implements a self-contained, serverless, zero-configuration, transactional SQL database engine.  "
"SQLite is a software library that implements a self-contained, serverless, zero-configuration, transactional SQL database engine.  "
SQLite is the most widely deployed SQL database engine in the world.
The source code for  SQLite is in the public domain.  
SQLite is a relational database management system contained in a small (~350 KB) C programming library.
"In contrast to other database management systems,  SQLite is not a separate process that is accessed from the client application, but an integral part of  SQLite.  "
"SQLite is ACID-compliant and implements most of the SQL standard, using a dynamically and weakly typed SQL syntax that does not guarantee the domain integrity."
Providing a minimal reproducible example for an SQLite-related question is most usefully and conveniently done by showing a few lines in SQLite syntax (i.e. some create table ... and insert ... which make a tailored toy database with appropriate structure and sample data).
"This way, potential answerers can easily recreate the database you used for demonstrating the problem and quickly and efficiently provide solution proposals that are supported by test runs and test output."
Showing pictures of database viewers or table representations (even in ASCII art) does not provide the same benefits.
"If you already have created a database for demonstration purposes, consider using the .dump command of the SQLite commandline tool."
It will automatically give you the lines for exactly recreating the database.
Getting familiar with the commandline tool also is a good way of avoiding all potential errors in whatever programming language is used to handle the database.
"With the commandline tool, you can inspect and analyse data and structure directly.  "
"SQLite is commonly used to store data on Android, iOS, and Windows Phone apps since  SQLite has a simple implementation, easy to adapt, and quite fast."
"Unlike client-server database management systems, the SQLite engine has no standalone processes with which the application program communicates."
"Instead, the SQLite library is linked in and thus becomes an integral part of the application program."
"the application program uses  SQLite's functionality through simple function calls, which reduce latency in database access:"
function calls within a single process are more efficient than inter-process communication.
SQLite stores the entire database as a single cross-platform file on a host machine.
 Hibernate is an object-relational mapping (ORM) library for the Java language enabling developers to utilize POJO-style domain models in developers applications in ways extending well beyond Object/Relational Mapping.  
"Hibernate is the umbrella for a collection of libraries, most notably Hibernate ORM which provides Object/Relational Mapping for java domain objects. "
"In addition to its own \"native\" API, Hibernate ORM is also an implementation of the Java Persistence API (jpa) specification."
 Entity Framework is a LINQ-based object-database mapper for .NET.  
"Entity Framework supports change tracking, updates, and schema migrations for many databases."
"Please add a version-specific tag, when applicable.  "
Entity Framework is .NET's Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) tool that enables .NET
developers to work with relational data using domain-specific objects.  
Entity Framework eliminates the need for most of the data-access code that developers usually need to write.
"Either natively, or through third-party libraries,  Entity Framework supports most major RDBM products including SQL Server, MySQL, Oracle, PostgreSQL and SQLite.  "
Entity Framework also supports Microsoft's \"LINQ\" syntax and lambda-expressions.  
"core (EF-core) was introduced, having a completely new codebase which shares many concepts with the classic framework but differs considerably in mapping syntax, query translation and specific features."
"After version 1 and 2, EF-core 3 came with many breaking changes, marking the beginning of a more stable evolution path."
EF core 5 (versions keep track with .Net core versions) has far less breaking changes.
NuGet packages are available for .Net core 3 and .NET
Because of all these different versions it's very important to use the right tags when asking questions.
 Selenium is a popular open-source tool for automating web browsers.
"When using this tag, also include other tags for the specific components you are using, e.g. selenium-webdriver for the language bindings, selenium-ide, selenium-grid, etc."
The Selenium IDE is a portable software testing framework for web browser automation.
The Selenium IDE provides a record/playback tool for authoring tests without learning a test scripting language.
"Selenium provides a test domain-specific language (DSL) to write tests in a number of popular programming languages, including Java, C#, Ruby, Groovy, Python, PHP, and Perl."
Test playback is possible in most modern web browsers.
"Selenium 3 deploys on Windows, Linux, and Macintosh platforms."
"When using this tag, also include other tags for the specific components you are using, e.g. selenium-webdriver for the language bindings, selenium-ide, selenium-grid, etc."
Selenium 3 is the third installment of the Selenium software.
"The major change for Selenium 3, is that all RC users will find that Selenium 3 will not work by dropping in."
WebDriver users will find that Selenium 3 is just a drop-in replacement.
"These are some of the other improvements/changes: Selenium 2 WebDriver, the successor to Selenium 1, is the second installment of Selenium, and ties directly into the browser API that is provided by the browser manufacturer."
"Selenium 1, also known as Selenium RC (Remote Control), is the first version of Selenium which provided JavaScript libraries which would be injected into the browser."
"Selenium was originally developed by Jason Huggins, who was later joined by other programmers and testers at ThoughtWorks."
"Selenium is open source software, released under the Apache 2.0 license and can be downloaded and used personally or commercially without charge."
Selenium IDE is a complete integrated development environment (IDE) for Selenium tests.
"Selenium IDE is implemented as a firefox extension and allows recording, editing, and debugging tests."
Selenium IDE was previously known as Selenium Recorder.
Selenium IDE was originally created by Shinya Kasatani and donated to the Selenium project in 2006.
Selenium Recorder is a record and playback IDE for Selenium tests.
"Selenium Recorder is implemented as a firefox plugin and allows recording, editing, and debugging tests."
Selenium Recorder was initially created by SauceLabs and the source code base was given to the Selenium project with the plan to eventually replace 'Selenium IDE.
 Facebook Platform lets developers integrate developers apps directly into the Facebook social networking service.
Use this tag for questions which may arise when developing FOR Facebook.
this tag is NOT for support questions about using the Facebook website or the official Facebook app.
this tag is also NOT for questions of the “I want to implement a feature similar to what Facebook has” variety.  
Facebook Platform is a software environment provided by the social networking service Facebook for third-party developers to create third-party developers own applications and services that access data in Facebook.  
Facebook Platform lets developers integrate developers applications directly into the Facebook social networking serviceFacebook .  
"Facebook Platform offers a set of programming interfaces and tools which enable developers to integrate with the opengraph of personal relations and other things like songs, places, and Facebook pages."

 Flutter is an open-source UI software development kit created by Google.  
"Flutter is used to develop applications for Android, iOS, Linux, Mac, Windows, Google Fuchsia and the web from a single codebase."
"Flutter applications are written in the Dart programming language, and can connect to platform languages such as Java, Kotlin, Swift, and Objective-C. Flutter itself is built with C, C++, Dart, and Skia (a 2D rendering engine)."
"Flutter development is currently supported on Linux, Mac OS X, Chrome OS and Windows operating systems."
"Flutter is developed and maintained by Google and will be the main development SDK for Fuchsia, the expected and upcoming new Operating System also by Google."
Flutter is different than most other options for building mobile apps because Flutter uses neither WebView nor the OEM widgets that shipped with the device.
"Instead, Flutter uses Flutter own high-performance rendering engine and framework to draw widgets to the screen."
"Flutter also offers developers a highly productive and fast development experience, fast runtime and engine performance, and beautifully designed widgets that make for beautiful apps."
 REST (Representational State Transfer) is a style of software architecture for distributed hypermedia systems such as the World Wide Web.  
(Representational State Transfer) has increased in popularity relative to RPC architectures such as SOAP due to the intrinsic de-coupling of client from server that comes from having a uniform interface between heterogeneous systems.
"REST (REpresentational State Transfer) is an architectural style that uses identification of resources; manipulation of resources through representations; self-descriptive messages, and hypermedia as the engine of application state, to build distributed systems that are scalable and resilient to change."
The term was introduced and defined in 2000 by Roy Fielding in Roy Fielding doctoral dissertation.
Fielding is one of the principal authors of the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) specification versions 1.0 and 1.1.
"In simple language, REST is an alternative to SOAP based web services."
"Where SOAP tries to model the exchange between client and server as calls to objects, REST tries to be faithful to the web domain."
"A website's RESTful api is queried to find out information on a user, specified by a numerical ID."

 The term 'shell' refers to a general class of text-based interactive command interpreters most often associated with the Unix & Linux operating systems.  
"For questions about shell scripting, please use a more specific tag such as 'bash', 'powershell' or 'ksh'."
"Without a specific tag, a portable (POSIX-compliant) solution should be assumed, though using 'posix' in addition"
The term 'shell' refers to a general class of text-based command interpreters most often associated with the Unix & Linux operating systems.
"While some of these resemble each other closely, there are often subtle differences: All of ksh93, mksh and bash are supersets of the POSIX shell, which in turn is a superset of the original Bourne Shell."
"By default, 'shell' support mutually incompatible extensions in syntax and behavior, but also share some extensions (beyond what POSIX offers)."
"the original Bourne Shell and rc are, by default, not compatible with the POSIX shell family."
Questions about The Z Shell and rc samples should be clear about the environment and the version of the original Bourne Shell.
Tcsh comes originally as a design improvement to the original C shell.
the original C shell has been widely used before bash became the established shell.
One major popular system implementation was the Solaris family.
"The shell concepts ~ (tilde for home directory), history, path expansion (globbing), directory stack and aliases all originally came from the csh."
Some view the DOS 'cmd' prompt as a minimal shell of sorts.  
It is also possible to install Cygwin or MSYS/MSYS2 on Windows and emulate a Unix environment with complete shell capabilities or use the Windows Subsystem for Linux (\"Bash on Ubuntu on Windows\").
"In graphical user mode, terminal emulators are used to access the original C shell.  "
"Examples are xterm, GNOME Terminal, and OS X Terminal."
 Language Integrated Query (LINQ) is a Microsoft .NET Framework component that adds native data querying capabilities to .NET languages.
"Please consider using more detailed tags when appropriate, for example [linq-to-sql]"
", [linq-to-entities] / [entity-framework], or [plinq]"
"This tag is for questions about linq, a .NET-based DSL (Domain Specific Language), introduced in .net-3.5, for querying data sources such as databases, XML files or in-memory object lists."
"Please consider using more detailed tags when appropriate, for example linq-to-sql, linq-to-entities / entity-framework, or plinq."
"All data sources can be queried using the exact same, readable and easy-to-use syntax - or rather, syntaxes, because LINQ supports two notations: Inline LINQ or query syntax, where queries are expressed in a SQL-like language, with dialects in both C# and VB.NET."
All LINQ query operations consist of three distinct actions: This query would return the name of all products in the \"Toys\" category with a price greater than or equal to 2.50.
"Other implementations of LINQ can be found on the Internet, such as LINQ to SharePoint, LINQ to Twitter, LINQ to CSV, LINQ to Excel, LINQ to JSON and LINQ to Google."
"There are also lots of extensions for LINQ available, which add more operators to the ones .NET offers."
"A variety of those are open-source projects, for example MoreLINQ."
 Loops are a type of control flow structure in programming in which a series of statements may be executed repeatedly until some condition is met.
A loop is a fundamental programming idea that is commonly used in writing programs.
"A loop can be categorized in two different ways, A loop which checks for the condition before the iteration is known as Entry Controlled loops - for example A loop which checks the condition after the iteration is knows as Exit Controlled loop  - for example"
Most languages provide only a subset of loop types described above.
For example: in Python there are only foreach (keyword for) and while loops.
"In some languages, there are two keywords that simplify the task of implementing a more advanced control flow: break and continue."
"The former allows you to jump to the operator immediately after the loop, the latter allows you to jump to the end of the current iteration."
Example: implementation of do-until loop in Python using the break keyword: The tag loops can be used for programming related problems in implementing loops feature of any programming language.
Please avoid theoretical questions related to tag loops on stackoverflow.

Apache Maven is a build automation tool used primarily for Java projects.
"Based on the concept of a Project Object Model (POM),  Apache Maven can manage a project's build, reporting, and documentation from a central piece of information.  "
Apache Maven primary goal is to allow a developer to comprehend the complete state of a development effort in the shortest period of time.  
Apache Maven adheres to the principle of \"convention over configuration\" that helps building Maven projects with very little configuration.
"Systems, libraries, and frameworks should assume reasonable defaults, and systems should \"just work\" without requiring unnecessary configuration."
"In order to attain this goal, there are several areas of concern that  Apache Maven attempts to deal with: The configuration of a  Apache Maven project is done by creating a file called pom.xml located at the root of a Maven project."
a file called pom.xml located at the root of the project is referred to as the POM file.
Each POM file inherits from a global Super POM that defined common properties for all  Apache Maven projects.
"If you see questions with this tag that specifically refer to the Maven versions 2.x, 3.x (or the legacy 1.x), please re-tag them with maven-2, maven-3 and maven-1, respectively."

" Vue.js is an open-source, progressive JavaScript framework for building user interfaces that aims to be incrementally adoptable.  "
Vue.js is mainly used for front-end development and requires an intermediate level of HTML and CSS.
Vue.js questions are highly version specific and should always be tagged with [vuejs2] or [vuejs3] in addition to this tag.  
"Vue.js is an open-source, progressive JavaScript framework for building user interfaces that aims to be incrementally adoptable."
"Instead of performing manual updates to the DOM, which can be repetitive and error prone (think jQuery), Vue embraces the idea of \"data-driven views,\" where changes in data drive changes in the DOM."
This idea forms the core of  Vue.js: a reactive data-binding system that is designed to make it extremely simple to keep your data and the DOM in sync.
"What makes Vue particularly powerful, however, is that Vue can be built upon, increasing Vue functionality from a simple view-model library to that of a fully fledged JavaScript framework capable of powering entire SPA's via supporting plugins and libraries such as Vue Router, Vue Resource, and Vuex."
"Vue is currently in development, and includes some notable changes and improvements detailed here on VueJS.org."
Questions that are version specific should be tagged with vuejs2 or vuejs3 respectively.
"To check out an in-depth guide with live examples or the official docs, visit vuejs.org."
"All that is required to use Vue in a project is to create a Vue instance, and tell it where to render in the DOM."
"The code below forms a simple, fully functioning Vue app: The code below forms a simple, fully functioning Vue app is often useful to share runnable snippets of code in questions regarding Vue components."
"Since Stack Snippets can't natively run Vue single file components (.vue files), it's necessary to do a little conversion work."
"To create a Stack Snippet containing Vue in a Stack Overflow post, make sure you: You may also want to replace your <template> HTML elements with some alternative (ie. <div>)"
"You can drop this straight into the HTML section of a snippet, or split this straight into the HTML and JavaScript sections accordingly."
Bear in mind that splitting this straight may make the code clearer to readers!
" Comma-Separated Values or Character-Separated Values (CSV) is a standard \"flat file database\" format for storing tabular data in plain text, consisting of an optional header row that lists the table fields delimited by commas or tabs or other delimiter character, followed by one or more rows (newline separated) representing the table records as delimited lists of the values."
Newlines and separator characters can appear within (quoted) fields.
CSV is a file format involving a plain text file with information separated by delimiters with the purpose of storing data in a table-structured format.
"CSV (comma separated values) files traditionally and most commonly use a comma delimiter (hence the name), but other characters can be used, such as semi-colons, tabs, pipe symbols (|), etc."
Information is often stored in CSV format to make it easy to transfer tables of data between applications.
Each row of a table is represented as a list of plain text (human-readable) values with a delimiter character between each discrete piece of data.
"Values may be enclosed in quotes, which is required if Values contain the delimiter as a value."
"The first row of data often contains headers of table's columns, which describe the meaning of the data in each column."
"In this example, the first row of CSV data serves as the \"header\" which describes the corresponding data below it."
Each successive line of the CSV file would then neatly fit into the same field as the first line.
There is no inherent way to describe within a CSV file whether the first row is a header row or not.
"Note that empty fields (fields with no available data, such as the third field in the last line) are place-held with commas so that the fields that follow may be correctly placed."
"Questions tagged CSV are expected to relate to programming in some way, for example, parsing/importing CSV files or creating CSV files programmatically."

 Unit testing is a method by which individual units of source code are tested to determine if individual units of source code are fit for use.
Unit testing is a method by which individual units of source code are tested to determine if individual units of source code are fit for use.   
"Intuitively, one can view a unit as the smallest testable part of an application."
In procedural programming a unit could be an entire module but is more commonly an individual function or procedure.
"In object-oriented programming a unit is often an entire interface, such as a class, but could be an individual method.   "
Unit tests are created by programmers or occasionally by white box testers during the development process.
"Ideally, each test case is independent from the others: substitutes like method stubs, mock objects, fakes and test harnesses can be used to assist testing a module in isolation."
"For example, these substitutes also known as Test Doubles can be used to isolate dependencies such as Databases and File System."
Unit tests are typically written and run by software developers to ensure that code meets its design and behaves as intended.
Unit testing is closely related to Test Driven Development.
The goal of unit testing is to isolate each part of the program and show that the individual parts are correct.
"A unit test provides a strict, written contract that the piece of code must satisfy."
"There are a lot of books about unit test in general and about specific frameworks to specific languages, some examples are:"
" A block of arbitrary information, or resource for storing information, accessible by the string-based name or path."
Files are available to computer programs and are usually based on some kind of persistent storage.
"A computer file is a block of arbitrary information, or resource for storing information, which is available to a computer program and is usually based on some kind of durable storage."
A file is durable in the sense that A file remains available for programs to use after the current program has finished.
"Computer files can be considered as the modern counterpart of paper documents which traditionally are kept in offices' and libraries' files, and this is the source of the term."
"In modern computer architectures, files are organized in a tree structure. "
"On the top, you have a root like C:\ in windows systems."
"There are several subfolders (inner nodes) below the root, e.g. Program Files or Users. "
"The computer files, which contain the data, are the leaves of that tree."
"On unix based systems, many types of system information are also represented as files, in filesystems such as sysfs and devfs, even though they don't represent information on a durable storage medium."
"directory, folder, stream, filesystem, block, file-io"
 A template for creating new objects that describes the common state(s) and behavior(s).
"A class usually represents a noun, such as a person, place or (possibly quite abstract) thing - it is a model of a concept within a computer program."
"Fundamentally, it encapsulates the state and behavior of the concept it represents."
it encapsulates state through data placeholders called attributes (or member variables or instance variables or fields); it encapsulates behavior through reusable sections of code called methods.
"More technically, a class is a cohesive package that consists of a particular kind of metadata."
"an interface and a structure describes how to interact with the class and an interface and a structure instances using methods, while the structure describes how the data is partitioned into attributes within an instance."
"A class may also have a representation (metaobject) at runtime, which provides runtime support for manipulating the class-related metadata."
"In object-oriented design, a class is the most specific type of an object in relation to a specific layer."
Computer programs usually model aspects of some real or abstract world (the Domain).
"Because each class models a concept, classes provide a more natural way to create such models."
"Each class in the model represents a noun in the domain, and the methods of the class represent verbs that may apply to that noun."
"For example in a typical business system, various aspects of the business are modeled, using such classes as Customer, Product, Worker, Invoice, Job, etc."
"An Invoice may have methods like Create, Print or Send, a Job may be Perform-ed or Cancel-led, etc."
"Once the system can model aspects of the business accurately, the system can provide users of the system with useful information about those aspects."
"Classes allow a clear correspondence (mapping) between the model and the domain, making it easier to design, build, modify and understand these models."
Classes provide some control over the often challenging complexity of such models.
"Classes can accelerate development by reducing redundant program code, testing and bug fixing."
"If a class has been thoroughly tested and is known to be a 'solid work', a class is usually true that using or extending the well-tested class will reduce the number of bugs - as compared to the use of freshly-developed or ad-hoc code - in the final output."
"In addition, efficient class reuse means that many bugs need to be fixed in only one place when problems are discovered."
Another reason for using classes is to simplify the relationships of interrelated data.
"Rather than writing code to repeatedly call a graphical user interface (GUI) window drawing subroutine on the terminal screen (as would be typical for structured programming), it is more intuitive."
"With classes, GUI items that are similar to windows (such as dialog boxes) can simply inherit most of GUI items that are similar to windows (such as dialog boxes) functionality and data structures from the window class."
The programmer then needs only to add code to the dialog class that is unique to The programmer operation.
"Indeed, GUIs are a very common and useful application of classes, and GUI programming is generally much easier with a good class framework."
 Directory-level configuration file used by Apache web servers.
Use this tag if and only if .htaccess content is directly involved in the topic.
"We know many people are using .htaccess, but kindly ask the members of the community to not use this tag, unless you know this tag is on-topic in your question."
"Also notice what this tag has to say about questions about _configuring_ Apache httpd and Apache potential off-topicness on stackoverflow The .htaccess (hypertext access) file is a configuration file for the Apache web server, allowing configuration settings to be made at a directory-specific level."
a directory-specific level overrides the server-wide or site-level settings in the main Apache server-level configuration but must be enabled in the server-level configuration to work.
Most (though not all) directory-specific Apache settings can be configured in .htaccess.
"One of the most common usages for it is URL redirection using mod_rewrite, which is used by many sites for SEO purposes and to provide easier-to-read URLs."
The Apache documentation has further information about mod_rewrite as well as simpler solutions for many common use cases.
.htaccess files are also commonly used to define custom error pages (e.g. for 404 errors).
".htaccess files can also be used for specifying directory-specific security and user authentication, configuring the PHP installation, file handlers and MIME types, output compression, and more."
"For more information on .htaccess files and how to use .htaccess files, see The Apache documentation."

"TensorFlow End Users - GETTING STARTED, TUTORIALS & HOW-TO'S  TensorFlow was originally developed and deployed on Linux systems but has been ported to other operating systems including Microsoft Windows and Apple MacOS."
The  TensorFlow community tends to favor Ubuntu Linux and support for Ubuntu installations is easier to find.
With the introductions of anaconda and docker containers along with jupyter notebooks setup of a  TensorFlow workstation and sharing of data has become easier.
The most common brand of GPU used in a  TensorFlow workstation is NVIDIA though the AMD Radeon product line is improving NVIDIA support for machine learning applications.
Using the CPU for  TensorFlow rather than using a GPU can result in much slower processing by an order of magnitude.

 Apache Spark is an open source distributed data processing engine written in Scala providing a unified API and distributed data sets to users for both batch and streaming processing.
Use cases for  Apache Spark often are related to machine/deep learning and graph processing.  
Apache Spark is an open source cluster computing system that aims to make data analytics fast ― both fast to run and fast to write.
"To run programs faster,  Apache Spark offers a general execution model based on the RDD data abstraction that can help optimizing arbitrary long operator graphs, and supports in-memory computing, which lets it query data faster than disk-based engines like hadoop.  "
"Apache Spark is not tied to the two-stage mapreduce paradigm, and promises performance up to 100 times faster than Hadoop MapReduce."
"Spark provides primitives for in-memory cluster computing that allows user programs to load data into a cluster's memory and query it repeatedly, making it well suited for interactive as well as iterative algorithms in machine learning or graph computing."
"Spark can be used to tackle stream processing problems with many approaches (micro-batch processing, continuous processing since 2.3, running SQL queries, windowing on data and on streams, running ML libraries to learn from streamed data, and so on ...)."
"To make programming faster,  Apache Spark provides clean, concise APIs in scala, java, python and r. You can also use  Apache Spark interactively from the scala, python and r shells to rapidly query big datasets."
"Spark runs on yarn, mesos, kubernetes, standalone, or in the cloud."
"it can access diverse data sources including hdfs, cassandra, hbase, amazon-s3 and google-cloud-platform."

" A date is a reference to a particular day represented within a calendar system, and consists of year, month and day."
"A date is an ambiguous interval in time, which usually refers to a day, month, and year in a particular calendar system."
A date by itself (such as Jan 1 2014) does not refer to a specific moment in time.
"Related concepts such as \"today\", \"yesterday\", and \"tomorrow\", or any individual day of the week such as \"Monday\" or \"Tuesday\", also have the same qualities.  "
They are loose terms that require a time zone in order to lock in to a specific range of time.
"In some programming languages, such as javascript, the Date type actually represents a date and time of day and is therefore misnamed."
"The most recognized calendar is the Gregorian calendar, but there are other known calendars such as the Hebrew or the Hijri (Muslim) calendar."
"Since both start at a different date from the Gregorian calendar's date, the dates in these calendars are different."

 Sorting is the process of applying some order to a collection of items.
Sorting is the process of applying some order to a collection of items.
"There are various algorithms for doing this, including mergesort, quicksort, and heapsort."
From the Sorting Algorithms Wikipedia entry: In computer-science a sorting-algorithm is an algorithm that puts   elements of a list in a certain order.
The most-used orders are   numerical order and lexicographical order.
Efficient sorting is   important for optimizing the use of other algorithms (such as search   and merge algorithms)
that require sorted lists to work correctly; it   is also often useful for canonicalizing data and for producing   human-readable output.

 A dictionary maps keys to values allowing efficient retrieval of values by keys.
"] TAG for mapping functions; and for geography, [maps]."
"A dictionary (also known as map, associative array, or symbol table) in computer science is a data structure that maps keys to values such that given a key its corresponding value can be efficiently retrieved."
"A dictionary (also known as map, associative array, or symbol table) in computer science is commonly implemented as a hash map which allow O(1) amortized lookup."
"Alternatively, A dictionary (also known as map, associative array, or symbol table) in computer science may be implemented as a sorted list, with lookup requiring a binary search and making the lookup O(log N) amortized instead."
"When tagging a question with dictionary, be sure to tag a question with dictionary with the language being used as well."

 Validation is used to check data to make sure  Validation fits whatever required specifications are set for  Validation.  
"Typically Validation is used in checking input data, and in verifying data before storage."
"Data validation is the process of ensuring that a program operates on clean, correct and useful data.  "
"It applies rules or constraints to check for correctness, meaningfulness, and security of data that are input to the system."
"The most common reasons for validation are to avoid entering data which violates a database schema, and to prevent unauthorized exploitation of a user interface."
"In evaluating the basics of data validation, generalizations can be made regarding the different types of validation, according to the scope, complexity, and purpose of the various validation operations to be carried out."
 An endpoint of a bi-directional inter-process communication flow.
"This often refers to a process flow over a network connection, but by no means is limited to such."
Not to be confused with WebSocket (a protocol) or other abstractions (e.g. socket.io).
"In computer networking, a socket* is an endpoint of a bidirectional inter-process communication flow across an Internet Protocol-based computer network, such as the Internet."
"An internet socket address is the combination of an IP address (the location of the computer) and a port (which is mapped to the application program process) into a single identity, much like one end of a telephone connection is the combination of a phone number and a particular extension."
the combination of a phone number and a particular extension is primarily used in the Transport Layer.
The term is believed to have originated with the Berkeley Sockets API for Unix ca. 1983.

 Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application level network protocol that is used for the transfer of content on the World Wide Web.  
Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) uses a client-request/server-response model.  
"Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is stateless, which means  Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) does not require the server to retain information or status about each user for the duration of multiple requests."
"However, for performance reasons and to avoid the connection-latency issues of TCP, techniques like persistent, parallel or pipelined connections may be used."
"These are all the methods supported by older browsers, but the HTTP 1.1 specification includes a few more: PUT, DELETE, TRACE, OPTIONS, CONNECT and PATCH."
The response is returned with a status code: Both the request and response are made up of a header and an optional body.
"a header and an optional body contains a list of key-value pairs, separated using new lines and colons."
"For example, a request may have headers like this: Note that in example a request is telling the server that The response can be sent with the body compressed with either gzip or DEFLATE encoding."
"a request needs a body if a request is sending additional data to the server, for instance, if sending information entered into a form."
"The response headers will include information telling the client how to deal with the response data, for instance, whether the client can cache the response data (and how long for)."
"The response body will have the requested data, such as the HTML of a web page or image data."
"HTTP is used by browsers to retrieve web content, but can also be used for data APIs, for instance, as a soap, rest, or graphql service."

The latest update supports development for the following:
" A layout defines the visual structure for a user interface, such as the UI for an activity, fragment or app widget."
An Android layout defines everything the user can see and touch.
"A layout is made up of View (like buttons and text) and ViewGroup (like lists, tables, or more Views) objects, all combined to make a View Hierarchy:  (from Android's UI Overview)"
You can create your layout in any combination of these two ways: Declare UI elements in XML. 
"Android provides a straightforward XML vocabulary that corresponds to the View classes and subclasses, such as those for widgets and layouts."
Your application can create View and ViewGroup objects (and manipulate View and ViewGroup objects ( properties) programmatically.
Each subclass of the ViewGroup class provides a unique way to display the views you nest within it.
Below are some of the more common layout types that are built into the Android platform.
 An object is any entity that can be manipulated by commands in a programming language.
"An object can be a value, a variable, a function, or a complex data-structure."
"In object-oriented programming, an object refers to an instance of a class."

 Object-oriented programming is a programming paradigm using \"objects\": an encapsulation consisting of data fields and methods together with data fields and methods interactions.
Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm using the concept of objects.
"These encapsulates data which is organized in the form of fields (often known as attributes) and code, in the form of procedures (often known as methods)."
Methods can access and often modify attributes of the object with which they are associated.
"In OOP, computer programs are designed based on having objects interacting among each other."
"OOP includes features such as data abstraction, encapsulation, messaging, modularity, polymorphism, and inheritance."

 Use this tag for questions specific to the 2008 version of Microsoft's SQL Server.
"Extended support for SQL Server 2008 and 2008 R2 have ended on July 9, 2019."
"If you're still using SQL Server 2008, you should seroiusly consider upgrading your SQL Server to a supported version."
"SQL Server 2008 (codename Katmai, version number 10.00) was released on August 6 2008, and aims to make data management self-tuning, self organizing, and self-maintaining with the development of SQL Server"
"Always On technologies, to provide near-zero downtime."
"your SQL Server also includes support for structured and semi-structured data, including digital media formats for pictures, audio, video, and other multimedia data."
"In current versions, such multimedia data can be stored as BLOBs (binary large objects), but such multimedia data are generic bitstreams."
Intrinsic awareness of multimedia data will allow specialized functions to be performed on such multimedia data.
"According to Paul Flessner, Senior Vice President, Server Applications, Microsoft Corp., SQL Server 2008 can be a data storage backend for different varieties of data: XML, email, time/calendar, file, document, spatial, etc as well as perform search, query, analysis, sharing, and synchronization across all data types."
Other new data types include specialized date and time types and a Spatial data type for location-dependent data.
"Better support for unstructured and semi-structured data is provided using the new FILESTREAM data type, which can be used to reference any file stored on the file system."
"Structured data and metadata about the file is stored in the SQL Server database, whereas the unstructured component is stored in the file system."
Such files can be accessed both via Win32 file handling APIs as well as via SQL Server using T-SQL; doing the latter accesses the file data as a BLOB.
Backing up and restoring the SQL Server database backs up or restores the referenced files as well.
"also natively supports hierarchical data and includes T-SQL constructs to directly deal with T-SQL constructs, without using recursive queries."
The Full-text search functionality has been integrated with the database engine.
"According to a Microsoft technical article, this simplifies management and improves performance. "
"data type represents geospatial data which has been projected from data type native, spherical, coordinate system into a plane."

"Approximately 70 methods are available to represent spatial operations for the Open Geospatial Consortium Simple Features for SQL, Version 1.1."
"SQL Server 2008 includes better compression features, which also helps in improving scalability."
SQL Server 2008 enhanced the indexing algorithms and introduced the notion of filtered indexes.
SQL Server 2008 also includes Resource Governor that allows reserving resources for certain users or workflows.
SQL Server 2008 also includes capabilities for transparent encryption of data (TDE) as well as compression of backups.
"SQL Server 2008 2008 supports the ADO.NET Entity Framework and the reporting tools, replication, and data definition will be built around the Entity Data Model."
"SQL Server Reporting Services will gain charting capabilities from the integration of the data visualization products from Dundas Data Visualization, Inc., which was acquired by Microsoft."
"On the management side, SQL Server Reporting Services includes the Declarative Management Framework which allows configuring policies and constraints, on the entire database or certain tables, declaratively."
The version of T-SQL Server Management Studio included with SQL Server 2008 2008
supports IntelliSense for T-SQL queries against a SQL Server 2008 2008 Database Engine.
"SQL Server 2008 also makes the databases available via Windows PowerShell providers and management functionality available as Cmdlets, so that the server and all the running instances can be managed from Windows PowerShell."

"an application development and database development tool from Microsoft is a member of the ms-office suite of applications, included in the Professional and higher editions or sold separately."
Applications built with Microsoft Access can be distributed to end users with a free run-time version of the application that lets users view databases without needing the full installation of Access.
"If you have a question about using a specific version, please tag your question appropriately so others know The current version you are using."
Ex: and access-vba or vba if your question involves VBA.
One of the most common problems with MS Access SQL is the use of a reserved word in a query or SQL string.
"It is often suggested that these words are bracketed, [RESERVED WORD], as is required for field (column) names containing spaces or special characters.  "
"But rather than trying to figure out what is and is not a reserved word and bracketing only those, using the convention of prefixing all field names with the table name ― or better yet, the alias ― will prevent this problem from occurring."
"This will save problems in other cases, not just reserved words.  "
For example: This also makes MS Access SQL compatible with other databases.
"The usual connection string for MS Access *.accdb files, that is, files created in Access 2007 format, is: The ACE connection string is backwards-compatible and will open"
"*.mdb files; however, for *.mdb files, you can also use: Jet is often installed by default on Windows systems, but ACE is not."
"Go is statically-typed, with a syntax loosely derived from C, adding automatic memory management, type safety, some dynamic typing capabilities, additional built-in types such as variable-length arrays (called slices) and key-value maps, and a large standard library."
Go (sometimes \"Golang\" for search-ability) is a general-purpose programming language.
"While originally created by Google, Go is an open source project with a large contributor base."
an open source project with a large contributor base aims to be efficient both for development and execution with a focus on fast compilation and increased maintainability of large projects.
"Go was originally targeted at systems programming tasks such as building server/web applications, high throughput middleware, and databases, but an open source project with a large contributor base has a growing ecosystem of libraries allowing an open source project with a large contributor base to be used for a wide variety of tasks such as developing end-user daemons, CLIs, and desktop/mobile applications."
"The first class concurrency mechanisms of Go make The first class concurrency mechanisms of Go easier to write programs that get the most out of multicore and networked machines, while an open source project with a large contributor base structural type system enables flexible and modular program construction."
Go compiles quickly to memory safe machine code yet has the convenience of garbage collection and the power of run-time reflection.
"It's a fast, statically typed, compiled language that develops like a dynamically typed, interpreted language, but performs like native code."
 Parsing refers to breaking an artifact into an artifact constituent elements and capturing the relationship between its constituent elements.
This tag isn't for questions about the self hosted Parse Platform (
use the [parse-platform] tag) or parse errors in a particular programming language (use the appropriate language tag instead).
Parsing refers to the action by software of breaking an artifact into an artifact constituent elements and capturing the relationship between its constituent elements.
"When an artifact is a stream of arbitrary text, parsing is often used to mean breaking the stream into constituent atoms (called words, tokens or lexemes)."
"When an artifact is a stream of natural language text, parsing is used to mean breaking the stream into natural language elements (words and punctuation) and discovering the structure of the text as phrases or sentences."
"When an artifact is a stream of text corresponding to a computer language (or other formal language), parsing consists of applying any of a variety of parsing algorithms (ad hoc, recursive descent, LL, LR, Packrat, Earley or other) to the source text (often broken into lexemes by another lower level parser called a \"lexer\") to verify the validity of the source language, and often to construct a parse tree representing the grammar productions used to tile the text."
The term can be applied more generally to analyzing any complex structure such as a binary data file or a graph.

" JSP (JavaServer Pages) is a Java-based view technology running on the server machine which allows you to write template text in (the client side languages like HTML, CSS, JavaScript and so on) and interact with backend Java code.  "
"JSP (JavaServer Pages) is a Java view technology running on a server which allows you to write template text in client-side languages like HTML, CSS, JavaScript and so on.  "
JSP (JavaServer Pages) supports the so-called taglibs which are backed by pieces of Java code with which you can control the page flow
"JSP (JavaServer Pages) also supports Expression Language (EL), with syntax like ${} which can be used to access backend data (actually, the attributes which are available in the page, request, session and application scopes), mostly in combination with taglibs."
"When  JSP (JavaServer Pages)  JSP (JavaServer Pages) is requested for the first time or when the webapp starts up, the servlet container will compile the JSP file into a class extending HttpServlet and use the JSP file during the webapp's lifetime."
You can find the generated source code in the server's work directory.
"On a  JSP (JavaServer Pages) request, the servlet container will execute the compiled  JSP (JavaServer Pages) class and send the generated output (usually just HTML/CSS/JS) through the web server over the network to the client side, which in turn displays the servlet container in the browser."
How to install JDK or JRE is outlined here: https://docs.oracle.com/javase/9/install/overview-jdk-9-and-jre-9-installation.htm Installing a servlet container is generally just a matter of downloading the zip/gz file and extracting a servlet container at the location to your choice.
This example uses JSTL and EL to display the user IP and today's date.
Save This example as /hello.jsp and open This example by http://localhost:8080/contextname/hello.jsp.
"If JSTL doesn't work (the JSTL tags are not parsed/executed and still there in generated HTML output when you right-click and View Source in the browser), then probably the servlet container doesn't support the servlet container out of the box (like Tomcat)."
You can install the servlet container by just dropping jstl-1.2.jar in /WEB-INF/lib.
"If it still doesn't work, then refer JSTL info page for more detail."
You can also inline raw Java code in a JSP file using scriptlets (those <% %> things).
use is however as per the JSP coding conventions discouraged for other purposes than quick prototyping.
"It is easy to write unmaintainable code with JSP, so some best practices have been developed.  "
A fundamental practice is to use JSP as the view in the model view controller design pattern.  
This is sometimes referred to as the Model 2 design where Servlets are used as the Controller.  
"The model can be JavaBeans, POJOs, or even JPA entities.  "
"Other best practices include avoiding scriplets, creating reusable template tags, and use JSTL to avoid re-inventing the wheel."
"To pre-load data for display in a JSP and to post-process a form submit, you'd like to use a Servlet."
"It's important to realize that JSP runs in the web server, producing HTML output and that JavaScript is part of the HTML output that runs in the browser only."
So JSP and JavaScript don't run in sync as you might expect from the coding.
"To let JavaScript \"access\" JSP variables, all you need to do is to let JSP/JSTL/EL print it as if it is a Javascript variable."
"This way any Javascript function, once executed in the browser, can access the browser."
"The below example prints the server side session ID as a JavaScript variable using EL: If you open Servlets tag info page in a browser and do a View Source, then you'll see something like:"
(note that those single quotes were thus mandatory to represent a JavaScript string value!)
"Then, to let JSP \"access\" JavaScript variables, you need to send the JavaScript variable back to the server using an HTTP request, since that's the only way to send data from the browser to a webserver."
You could: See also Access Java / Servlet / JSP / JSTL / EL variables in JavaScript.
"Since Java EE 6, JSP has been succeeded by Facelets as the default view technology for the Java EE MVC framework JSF (JavaServer Faces)."
"Since the Java EE 6 tutorial, JSP is not treated in detail any longer."
You need to head back to the Java EE 6 tutorial if you want to learn JSP.

 A ListView is a graphical screen control or widget provided by UI libraries in a majority of modern operating systems to show items in a list form.
"Although there are many types of  A ListView controls across platforms and operating-systems, generally  A ListView is considered to be a type of enhanced list control with support for features such as columns (and column headers) and per-item images."
"The ListView control is used extensively in the Windows UI shell, providing the display surface for the Explorer's folder view, for example."
The ListView control is provided by the Common Controls library and can be used by any application to display data.

 Data type that \"points to\" another value stored in memory.
A pointer variable contains a memory address of some other entity (variable or function or other entity).
"This tag should be used for questions involving the use of pointers, not references."
"The most common programming languages using pointers are C, C++, Go, and assembly languages."
"Other helpful tags are method, function, struct, etc."
A pointer is a data type that \"points to\" another value stored in memory using A pointer address.
Pointers have a variety of performance benefits in repetitive operations.
"For example, copying a pointer is \"cheaper\" than copying the value that a pointer points to because only the address must be copied."
"Pointers are an important concept in many high-level programming languages, including C and C++."
The Wikipedia page for pointers has a fairly in-depth introduction to the concept.
 Windows Communication Foundation is a part of the .NET Framework that provides a unified programming model for rapidly building service-oriented applications.
According to the Microsoft Developer Center: Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) is a part of the .NET Framework that provides a unified programming model for rapidly building service-oriented applications that communicate across the web and the enterprise.
Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) is a tool often used to implement and deploy a service-oriented architecture (SOA).
Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) is designed using service-oriented architecture principles to support distributed computing where services have remote consumers.
Clients can consume multiple services; services can be consumed by multiple clients.
"Services typically have a WSDL interface (Web Services Description Language) that any Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) client can use to consume the service, regardless of which platform the service is hosted on."
Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) implements many advanced Web services
"(WS) standards such as WS-Addressing, WS-ReliableMessaging and WS-Security."
"Framework 4.0, Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) also provides RSS Syndication Services, WS-Discovery, routing and better support for REST services."
"The Windows Communication Foundation (or WCF), previously known as \"Indigo\", is a runtime and a set of APIs in the .NET Framework for building connected, service-oriented applications."
A Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) client connects to Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) service via an endpoint.
Each service exposes Each service contract via one or more endpoints.
An endpoint has an address (which is a URL specifying where the endpoint can be accessed) and binding properties that specify how the data will be transferred.
 Authentication is the process of providing a proof of identity or verifying identity.
Authentication is the process of providing a proof of identity or verifying identity.
"This might involve confirming the identity of a person or software program, tracing the origins of an artifact, or ensuring that a product is what a product packaging and labeling claims to be."
"Authentication is different than Authorization, which is the step of allowing access to a resource."
Authentication and authorization usually happen together to verify identity and then allow access.
"The first type of authentication is accepting proof of identity given by a credible person who has evidence on the said identity, or on the originator and the object under assessment as the originator's artifact respectively."
The first type of authentication is comparing the attributes of the object itself to what is known about objects of that origin.
"For example, an art expert might look for similarities in the style of painting, check the location and form of a signature, or compare the object to an old photograph."
The first type of authentication relies on documentation or other external affirmations.
"The ways in which someone may be authenticated fall into three categories, based on what is known as the factors of authentication: something the user knows, something the user has, and something the user is."
"Each authentication factor covers a range of elements used to authenticate or verify a person's identity prior to being granted access, approving a transaction request, signing a document or other work product, granting authority to others, and establishing a chain of authority."
" A batch file is a text file containing a series of commands that are executed by the command interpreter on MS-DOS, IBM OS/2, or Microsoft Windows systems."
"Batch files are text-based scripts, usually saved with the .bat"
"They are executed by the command processor (typically COMMAND.COM on MS-DOS and earlier versions of Windows, cmd.exe on IBM OS/2 and later version of Windows)."
"Note that, while batch files are still supported under Windows, recent versions have the much more expansive PowerShell."
This is the source code to a typical \"Hello world\" program in batch programming: Note the !
The tag batch-file can be used for programming-related problems in writing a batch script file for a Windows-based operating system.
Note the batch-file tag is not to be used for questions referring to a \"batch of files\" or referring to the \"Spring Batch\" framework but for questions related to the shell language only.

A variable is a named data storage location in memory.
"Using variables a computer program can store numbers, textual data, binary-data, or a combination of any of these data types."
"The data can be passed around in a program by copying The data from variable to variable or by referencing variables, i.e. defining from which variable a receiving code part is to take the contained data."
Variables which are only accessible within a certain function are termed \"local variables\".
"A \"global variable\", or one with indefinite scope, may be referred to anywhere in a computer program."
"In some programming-languages, variables are constrained by a specific data type."
"Data types may vary across languages, but share many commonalities."
Composite data types consist of usually more than one of the primitive types and/or even other composite types.
"Some languages contain extra primitives: Tuples (Python), Linked Lists (Lisp), Hash Tables (Lisp, Perl, Python, Lua, D)."
"Some programming languages allow variables that store functions, that can be stored in data structures, passed as parameters to other functions, or returned as a result from other functions."
"The specifics of variable allocation and the representation of variable allocation values vary widely, both among programming languages and among implementations of a given language."
"Many language implementations allocate space for local variables (whose extent lasts for a single function call) on the stack, and Many language implementations memory is automatically reclaimed when the function returns."
"More generally, in name binding, the name of a variable is bound to the address of some particular block (contiguous sequence) of bytes in memory, and operations on the variable manipulate that block."
Referencing is more common for variables whose values have large or unknown sizes when the code is compiled.
"Such variables reference the location of the value instead of storing the value itself, which is allocated from a pool of memory called the heap."

 Debugging is a methodical process of finding and fixing bugs in a computer program.
"** This tag is ONLY for questions about debugging techniques or the process of debugging This tag, NOT for requesting help debugging your code."
"Debugging is a methodical process of finding and fixing bugs in a computer program or a piece of electronic hardware, thus making it behave as expected."
"Debugging tends to be harder when various subsystems are tightly coupled, as changes in one may cause bugs to emerge in another."
"Many books have been written about debugging, as it involves numerous aspects, including interactive debugging, control flow, integration testing, log files, monitoring (application, system), memory dumps, profiling, Statistical Process Control, and special design tactics to improve detection while simplifying changes."
"Four key techniques for debugging are syntax checking, adding comments, stepping and using breakpoints."
"Many good tools exist, including online-only tools, to check the syntax of your code."
"Checking the syntax of your code means checking your code obeys the basic rules of the programming language or tool being used (e.g., missing end brackets, no end to an if statement)."
"Syntax checking is done automatically in compiled languages (eg, C, C++, pascal) but not in interpreted or scripted languages (eg, javascript, perl, HTML)."
Some code editors include syntax highlighting or validation.
"Syntax checks can also be carried out for some data files or stylesheets, for example the JSON or CSS that your code uses."
"Syntax checks will quickly help find spelling mistakes, missing or repeated statements, invalid expressions, and may also give warnings or suggested improvements."
"Syntax checkers are also known as linters, or code validators."
Checking for valid syntax before running can identify errors quickly.
"Program stepping refers to using a tool to running your code line by line or a section at a time, examining the results including variables, the result of expressions, and the order that the program's steps are executed in."
"This is particularly useful in programs which do not give an error, or contain infinite loops."
"Breakpoints are particular places in your code in which you want to temporarily stop the code in order to check if the code is running correctly so far, for example to check whether a value typed in was correctly stored in a variable you would add a breakpoint immediately after that line, then check the result."
Using several different breakpoints allows you to very quickly find the area of the code which is causing the problem.
"Breakpoints can be created using a debugging tool, or manually a very simple form of breakpoint could be adding a pop-up messages that waits for you to respond with OK, and can display a message containing program information (e.g., line number, function's name, values of variables)."
Adding comment to your code is good practice and allows you to describe the purpose of a short piece of code in human-readable form.
"Programming languages ignore all lines containing comments, but Programming languages can help you later to update your code or resolve problems if you add Programming languages as you first begin coding."

"To avoid answering the same questions over and over again, please check the list of interesting questions and this checklist: A lot of errors mentioning some sort of parse error on input... are caused by the user mixing spaces and tabs in the indentation, so please check that is not the case."
"Also, you should probably set up your editor to convert tabs into spaces."
"While  Haskell's type system is very powerful, Haskell's type system behavior can sometimes be confusing."
"The more explicit type signatures you add, the less possibilities there are for the compiler to deduce absurd relations."
"Type signatures also make questions more understandable, because it's obvious what you want a function to do."
"In case of performance issues, please make sure that you compile your code with optimizations enabled."
Passing -O2 to the compiler makes many performance issues go away.

 Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) is an obsolete cryptographic protocol superseded by Transport Layer Security (TLS) that provides secure communications over the Internet.
"Often, SSL is used as a blanket term and refers to both the SSL protocol and the Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol."
"The most recent version of the protocol is TLS version 1.3, specified by the IETF in RFC 8446. '"
"Secure Sockets Layer' was originally a comp.sources Usenet post in the 1980s, using a fairly primitive security protocol."
"Netscape Communication Corp pioneered a fairly primitive security protocol, in SSL, the first version deployed, followed by SSL."
"At that point the IETF the IETF decided to standardize on a fairly primitive security protocol, so RFC 2246 defined the next version of a fairly primitive security protocol."
There was some uncertainty over the intellectual property rights to the SSL name so the IETF chose the name Transport Layer Security (TLS).
Today the names SSL and TLS are essentially synonyms.
"However, if you refer to a specific version you should include the correct name, e.g SSL 3.0 or TLS 1.1."
Current security standards forbid running any SSL version or TLS 1.0 (due to Current security standards various flaws).
Current security standards is recommended to run only TLS 1.2 and TLS 1.3.
"TLS was originally developed to run above a connection-oriented protocol, i.e. TCP."
"Later, TLS modified to run over connectionless protocols like UDP by way of Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS)."
"TLS is a mature protocol, now more than 20 years old, with vast support on a multitude of clients, servers, platforms, and libraries."
"However, there is some complexity around the cipher suites, the TLS Extensions, and the certificate validation, that regularly introduced reasons ending in non-interoperability. "
"Perhaps the most well-known protocol that uses TLS is the HTTPS protocol, which is the HTTP protocol running over TLS."
"Stackoverflow is for programming questions, and that is also true for questions tagged with TLS or SSL."
"In particular, server configuration questions are off-topic and instead should be asked on ServerFault."

 Portable Document Format (PDF) is an open standard for electronic document exchange maintained by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO).
"Questions can be about creating, reading, editing PDFs using different languages."
"The official ISO Specification (ISO 32000-1, a.k.a. 'PDF-1.7') is important as a reference, but The official ISO Specification (ISO 32000-1, a.k.a. 'PDF-1.7') is not exactly written for PDF beginners."
"Beginners may start with these two easy-to-read resources: pdf-form, pdf-generation, pdf-parsing, pdf-conversion, abcpdf, core-graphics, ghostscript, fpdf, itext, itextsharp, pdfbox, pdfium, pdflatex, pdfsharp, pdftk, postscript, pypdf, tcpdf, wkhtmltopdf, zend-pdf, pdfclown Related questions on Stack Overflow generally fall into the following domains: The first domain has been covered in depth, and any question you have is likely already answered."
Extracting text from a PDF may not be possible without resorting to Optical Character Recognition (OCR).
"Letters can be encoded as font glyphs, line art, vector graphics, or raster images."
a PDF files generally contain drawing instructions.
There's no such thing as \"a table\" in most a PDF files.
"There are lines, glyphs, and raster images (and clipping, and color spaces, and so forth)."
It is all but impossible to determine what is or isn't a table in an arbitrary a PDF file.
"A glyph has an appearance; whereas, a character has meaning."
Each font in a a PDF may or may not map a PDF glyphs to characters.
"If at all possible, use the source data to extract information, rather than relying on a PDF."
"This file format is designed for visual consistency, and very little useful normalized data can be extracted from This file format contents."
"A a PDF file is often a combination of vector graphics, text, and bitmap graphics."
The basic types of content in a a PDF are: For additional information about This file format see:
 Implementation questions about machine learning algorithms.
"General questions about machine learning (concepts, theory, methodology, terminology etc) should be posted to machine learning (concepts, theory, methodology, terminology etc) specific communities."
Machine learning revolves around developing self-learning computer algorithms that function by virtue of discovering patterns in data and making intelligent decisions based on such patterns.
Machine learning is a subfield of computer science that evolved from the study of pattern recognition and computational learning theory in artificial intelligence.
Machine learning explores the construction and study of algorithms that can learn from and make predictions about data.
Such algorithms operate by building a model from example inputs in order to make data-driven predictions or decisions rather than following strictly static program instructions.

 This tag is EXCLUSIVELY for PROGRAMMING questions that are directly related to Unix; general software issues should be directed to the Unix & Linux Stack Exchange site or to Super User.
Unix is a general-purpose OS that was developed by Bell Labs in the late 1960s and today exists in various versions.
Unix can be used for Unix system programming related problems.  
This tag can also contain programming questions about using the Unix platform.
"For non-programming Unix usage questions, visit the Unix & Linux Stack Exchange site."
"Unix was developed as an in-house operating system for AT&T, but in the 1980s became both a prime academic operating system (with U.C. Berkeley's version, called BSD, being the reference platform for development of what would become the Internet) and a commercial success in the form of AT&T's System V, Microsoft/SCO's XENIX (PCs) and various workstation versions from Sun, Silicon Graphics, and others."
"In the 1990s, Sun's Solaris and the free Unix clone Linux would rise in popularity."
the Unix & Linux Stack Exchange is largely Unix-compatible but lacks the trademark.

" Asynchronous programming is a strategy for deferring operations with high latency or low priority, usually in an attempt to improve performance, responsiveness, and / or composability of software."
"Such strategies are usually employed using some combination of event-driven programming and callbacks, and optionally making use of concurrency through coroutines and / or threads."
"Asynchronous programming is a strategy for deferring operations with high latency or low priority, usually in an attempt to improve performance, responsiveness, and / or composability of software."
"Such strategies are usually employed using some combination of event-driven programming and callbacks, and optionally making use of concurrency through coroutines and / or threads."
Asynchronous programming is used in many situations: Asynchronous programming models can aid in software composition in many languages (notably languages where functions are first-class types) and APIs providing callback-based completion messaging.
Proper use of this programming methodology can improve throughput and improve responsiveness by reducing total latency of job batches when executed in parallel.
This approach can also result in an increase in system throughput at the cost of increased operational latency resulting from deferred processing.

" Generics are a form of parametric polymorphism found in a range of languages, including .NET languages, Java, Swift, and Rust."
# Generics is a language feature found in certain languages to enable a form of parametric-polymorphism.
C# Generics typically allow the programmer to express concepts such as \"A list of some type T\" in a type-safe manner.
"Prior to the addition of generics to the java language and the .net clr, programmers using these languages were forced to downcast from the base Object when using some general purpose classes, such as collection classes."
"With the addition of generics, the programmer can instead use types such as List<int> to create type-safe lists which only store int objects."
In-depth detail for examples and concepts specifically for C# Generics is provided by Microsoft here.
"Unlike c++ templates, generics are typically limited to simple type substitution, without the ability of templates to specialize in specific types (infamously misused in the C++ standard library in std::vector<bool> which behaves radically different from any other std::vector<T>)."
"This also means that generics are not well suited for generic-programming, which typically relies on an ability to tailor generic algorithms for specific parameter types (again using a C++ example, pointers are usable with any generic algorithm expecting arguments to be iterators)."
 Selenium WebDriver provides the WebDriver API for controlling browsers in different programming languages (\"language bindings\").
"When using this tag, also add a tag for the programming language you are using.  "
Selenium WebDriver is an API framework that allows communication and control of most web browsers.  
"Selenium WebDriver, as  Selenium WebDriver is often called, focuses mostly on user interaction, preventing actions a typical \"user\" would not be able to do (e.g. setting element values directly and interacting with elements that are hidden by menus or are display: none)."
"However,  Selenium WebDriver does allow direct JavaScript interaction, allowing development even in those areas.  "
"Selenium WebDriver has gained popularity due to  Selenium WebDriver support for almost all major browsers,  Selenium WebDriver availability for many popular development languages, and  Selenium WebDriver active development and support of the core framework."

 Hadoop is an Apache open-source project that provides software for reliable and scalable distributed computing.
"The core consists of a distributed file system (HDFS) and a resource manager (YARN).   "
"Various other open-source projects, such as Apache Hive use  Hadoop as persistence layer."
"The Apache64 Hadoop64 project develops open-source software for reliable, scalable, distributed computing."
"\"Hadoop\" typically refers to the software in the project that implements the map-reduce data analysis framework, plus the distributed file system (HDFS) that underlies it."
"There is a Name Node, typically you have at least one Name Node"
"And that at least one Name Node will accept the requests coming in from client applications to do some processing and at least one Name Node will then use some Data Nodes, and typically we have lots of Data Nodes that will share the processing work across between some Data Nodes."
And the way some Data Nodes do that is they all have access to a shared file system that typically is referred to as the Hadoop Distributed File System or HDFS.  
"Hadoop also works with other filesystems, the platform specific \"local\" filesystem, Blobstores such as Amazon S3 and Azure storage, as well as alternative distributed filesystems."
"Since version 0.23,  Hadoop disposes of a standalone resource manager : yarn."
"yarn makes it easier to use other modules alongside with the MapReduce engine, such as : Commercial support is available from a variety of companies."
 A session refers to the communication between a single client and a server.
A session is specific to the user and for each user a new session is created to track all the requests from the user.
"A session is a semi-permanent interactive information interchange, also known as a dialogue, a conversation or a meeting, between two or more communicating devices, or between a computer and user (see Login session)."
"A session is set up or established at a certain point in time, and torn down at a later point in time."
An established communication session may involve more than one message in each direction.
"A session is typically, but not always, stateful, meaning that at least one of the communicating parts needs to save information about the session history in order to be able to communicate, as opposed to stateless communication, where the communication consists of independent requests with responses."
An established session is the basic requirement to perform a connection-oriented communication.
A session also is the basic step to transmit in connectionless communication modes.
However any unidirectional transmission does not define a session.
"For questions related to an aspect of the World Wide Web, use a more specific tag for the World Wide Web, such as [uri], [html], [http] or [w3c]."
The World Wide Web is a technology that connects various kinds of systems with interlinked hypertext documents accessed using networking protocols.
"The credit of inventing the World Wide Web goes to many researchers, but The World Wide Web was Tim Berners-Lee also known as TimBL who not only proposed the idea of WWW but also gave Tim Berners-Lee also known as TimBL full contribution in development of 3 very significant technologies: The World Wide Web is an interconnected network which works as a bridge not only between two terminal ends (Web browser & Web server) but also to connect client machines to database servers with controlled access."
"With a Web browser (client), one can view web pages that may contain text, images, videos, and other multimedia, and navigate between videos, and other multimedia via hyperlinks."
The default port for requests and responses via HTTP protocol is port 80.
"A web server, on other hand, receives the client's requests and generates the proper response for the client's requests."
This includes an HTTP status code (like 200 Ok or 404
"Not Found), a list of HTTP headers (which control things like response format and cookies), and the response body (like HTML content)."
 Software testing is any activity aimed at evaluating an attribute or capability of a program or system and determining that  Software testing meets  Software testing required results.
"For better answers, any questions about Software Quality Assurance & Testing should be asked on SQA - https://sqa.stackexchange.com/."
You can ask only programming related questions on Stack Overflow and that too can be asked on SQA Software testing is an investigation conducted to provide developers and stakeholders with information about the quality of the product or service under test.
"Software testing can also provide an objective, independent view of SQA Software to allow the business to appreciate and understand the risks of software implementation."
"Test techniques include, but are not limited to, the process of executing a program or application with the intent of finding software bugs (errors or other defects)."
Software testing can be stated as the process of validating and verifying that a software program/application/product: There are white-box-tests and black-box-tests.
A white-box test verifies the structure of a software product whereas the block-box test validates the requirements.
"Software testing, depending on the testing method employed, can be implemented at any time in the development process."
"However, most of the test effort occurs after the requirements have been defined and the coding process has been completed."
"As such, the methodology of the test is governed by the software development methodology adopted."
The following types of tests are commonly used to denote the level of detail the tests are focused on:
Agile development model places added emphasis on testing.
Test driven development advocates writing a test for a feature before developing the actual feature.
Additional information: Shift-left testing is an approach to software testing and system testing in which testing is performed earlier in the lifecycle (i.e. moved left on the project timeline).
